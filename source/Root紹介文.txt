The nefarious Marquise de Cat has seized the great woodland, intent on harvesting its riches. Under her iron rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Woodland Alliance will seek to strengthen their presence by building hideouts and launching missions to subvert the rule of the cats.

In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the Vagabonds, who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Allianceâ€™s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.

Meanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander whom they hope will lead their faction to reclaim their ancient birthright. The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.

Root is the next step in our development of asymmetric design. Like in Vast: the Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different victory condition. Now, with the aid of gorgeous, multi-use cards, a truly asymmetric design has never been more accessible. 

In Root, the players drive the narrative, and the differences among the roles create unparalleled interaction and replayability. Leder Games invites you and your family to explore the fantastic world of Root!

Root is designed by Cole Wehrle (Pax Pamir, An Infamous Traffic, and John Company) and brought to life by master illustrator Kyle Ferrin (Vast: The Crystal Caverns, Vast: The Fearsome Foes, Stitches).
