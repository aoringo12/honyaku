ゲーム終了得点：
When the last Pollution token is removed from the Global Impact track, the end of the game is triggered. Once the active player’s turn ends, each player takes one more turn, including the active player. 

e price of Oil remains $5 during the final turns.
Players may still gain Pollution as a result of their actions;Pollution tokens gained during these final turns are drawn from the general supply instead of from the Global Impact track.
 e final turn each player takes might be either a Work turn or a Generate turn;it is up to the players to anticipate the endgame’s approach and to time their gameplay accordingly.

Once all players have taken their final turn, the game is over and the scores are determined!


DETERMINING SCORES

Players tally the VP they earn from all of the below sources, advancing their markers along the Score track to reflect the gains and adding to whatever VP were earned during the game from various sources.
Structures:Total the VP of your owned Structures

Players tally the VP they earn from all of the below sources, advancing their markers along the Score track to reflect the gains and adding to whatever VP were earned during the game from various sources.
Structures:Total the VP of your owned Structures.
Energy Dice:Gain 2 VP for each
Energy die on your player mat.
United Nations track:Score VP for the space your player marker is in.  e player who moved furthest on the track receives the leader bonus of 3 VP. (If there is a tie, split the leader bonus evenly between tied players, rounding down.)

Achievements: Reveal your Achievements and determine the value of each. Remember that each Achievement has a maximum value of 5 VP. (is simply means that if you merit more than 5VP according to the Achievement, earn 5VP instead.)

Environment: Score 1 VP for each unpolluted space in your Environment. Score column bonuses for the 3rd, 4th, and 5th columns, for each column that is entirely unpolluted.

e winner of the game is the player with the most Victory Points. at player has built the most powerful Energy Empire!

Tiebreaker: Remaining resources; Money (divided by 2 and rounded down) + Plastic + Steel + Science + Oil.

Green earns the 20 VP shown on her Structures

Green earns the 15 VP for the space she’s in on the United Nations track, plus the 3 VP leader bonus

Green earns 15 VP for the four Achievements she’s collected.

Green earns 7 VP for 7 unpolluted spaces in her Environment, plus the rightmost column bonus of 3VP for the unpolluted rightmost column.
Adding the 71 points tallied above to the 35 points she earned during the game, Green’s final score is 106!


SETUP

Getting Started. Place the main board in a central location. Create stockpiles of resources, dice, Pollution tokens, and Oil Well tokens within reach of all players.


Shuffle cards and tiles. Shuffle each of the six decks of cards separately, leaving the decks face down. Also shuffle the Achievement tiles and leave them face down as a supply stack.


MAIN BOARD

Global Impact cards. Without revealing them, draw three Early Global Impact cards and three Late Global Impact cards. Place them face down in a row along the bottom edge of the board, with the Early cards to the left. Return the rest of the Global Impact cards to the game box;they won’t be used in this game.
Global Impact track. Stack the appropriate number of Pollution tokens from the supply (according to the chart on the right) on each of the six pollution spaces of the Global Impact track.
For example in a 3-player game you’d stack 5 tokens on each spot.
Structure Markets. Place the three Structure card decks beside the board in a convenient location. (Leave room for seperate Structure discard piles beside each deck.) Fill each Structure market from right to left by drawing three cards from the corresponding Structure deck and placing them face up in the appropriate market. (Government cards into the Government market, and so on.)
Achievements. Draw 3 Achievement tiles and place them face-up on the Achievement spaces. Keep the face down Achievements stack nearby.
Player markers. Each player chooses their color for the game. Place 1 colored marker for each player on the zero space of the Score track, and the other colored marker for each player on the leftmost space of the United Nations track. Unused colors are returned to the box.
Neutral Workers (2-player Only). Take 3 Workers of an unused color, and place one on each of the three Structure market locations (Government, Industry, and Commerce).  ese workers remain on these locations for the entire game.


PLAYER SETUP

Player Mats. Each player takes the player mat of their color.
Starting Pollution. Each player takes one Pollution token from the supply and places it in the top-left space of their Environment grid.
Workers and Energy. Each player takes 3 Workers and 2 Energy of their color and places them on their player mat in the indicated spaces. Keep remaining Workers and Energy in a supply clearly separate from these ones so that there is no confusion about which ones are legitimately in play.
Nation & Achievement. Deal two Nation cards and two Achievement tiles face down to each player. Each player peeks at and selects one of each.  e selected Achievement is placed face down on the player mat in the indicated space, the other is shuffled back into the supply. Players reveal their selected Nation card, and turn the other card face-down to use the reference on the back. Players may peek at their own Achievements at any time.
Bonus Starting Resources. Each player takes the bonus starting resources, money, dice, and/or Workers indicated on their Nation card and places them on the appropriate spaces of their player mat.

Start Player. e start player is the person who used the least amount of fuel to get from their home to where the game is being played. Play order is clockwise from the start player. Each player receives extra starting money based on turn order, according to the chart on the right.


HOW TO PLAY

GAME STRUCTURE
Neutral Workers (2-player Only). Remember that you placed a permanent neutral Worker on each of the three Structure markets during Setup?ose Workers are taken into consideration for this purpose, which means that you will never be able to place a single unstacked Worker in any of those locations.
 e Manhattan Project:Energy Empire is a turn-based game. Beginning with the start player and proceeding clockwise, players take turns until the game ends;each turn may be either a Work turn or a Generate turn.  e end of the game is triggered when the last Pollution token is removed from the Global Impact track. At that point, each player gets one more turn, including the player who triggered the endgame.  en points are tallied to determine the winner!

player turns
On your turn, choose one of these two options:Work or Generate.
 en, carry out the phases in order for the choice you have made.
Restrictions:
• If you have no Workers remaining on your player mat, you must choose to Generate.
• If you Generated on your previous turn, you must choose to Work.


A WORK TURN
Work turns are where most of the action happens in the game. During Work turns you will be using the Workers, Energy, and other assets you have gathered to build Structures, visit other board locations, and activate your built Structures and Nation card for a variety of benefits.

A WORK TURN’S PHASES

1. Place a Worker on the main board
2. Activate Structures (and/or Nation card)

1. Place a Worker on the main board

Take one of your Workers from your player mat and place it on one of the 13 locations on the main board.  is is not optional and must be done.
Each location is connected to a grey box with a white Worker symbol;this box is where you should place your Worker. (See Locations on pages 14-16 for details about how the thirteen different main board locations work.)

e four Government locations are on the left (green) binder.  ey are the Government Structure market, Scientific Research, Education, and Clean Up.
 e five Industry locations are on the middle (brown) binder.  ey are the Industry Structure market, Mine, Oil Drilling, Chemistry, and Power Plant.
 e four Commerce locations are on the right (yellow) binder.
 ey are the Commerce
Structure market, Finance, Buy/Sell Oil, and Trade.

Requirements for placing on a location

To place on a location, you must have sufficient resources to perform the location’s action (if that action has a cost associated with it, indicated by the red Spend arrow). 

is is the Spend arrow. When you see it on a location or a card, it means that you must discard something (from your player mat into the general supply) in order to gain something. For example, the Clean Up location on the main board tells you that you must spend 1 Science to gain 2 Cleanup. 

To place on a location, you also must be placing the tallest stack in the location. If there are no Workers already in the location, this means that your single Worker will be enough, since it will be the tallest. However if the location is occupied (by any Workers, including your own from previous turns), you must stack your Worker on top of Energy before placing it so that your new stack is the tallest in the location.

Stacking your Worker on Energy

Energy used for stacking must come from your player mat. If you don’t have enough Energy to create the tallest stack in a location, you may not place a Worker there.

You may choose to place more Energy than is required (even if the location is unoccupied), in order to create a higher stack and make it more difficult for players to use that location later. 

You may not use additional Workers to make your stack taller; a stack may only be composed of any number of Energy with 1 Worker on top.

You may use a board location that you used on a previous turn, by building a new stack of Energy with a Worker on top, following the same rules; you may not add to a stack of your own that is in the location from a previous placement.

Neutral Workers (2-player Only). Remember that you placed a permanent neutral Worker on each of the three Structure markets during Setup? ose Workers are taken into consideration for this purpose, which means that you will never be able to place a single unstacked Worker in any of those locations.

After placing your Worker, you must carry out the action for that location. Pay costs (if any) by discarding the appropriate resources from your player mat to the general supply. (See Locations on pages 14-16 for details about how the thirteen different main board locations work.)

Example 1:Yellow wants to visit the Mine, so he places 1 Worker there. No Energy is required since the location was unoccupied... though he could have stacked some if he wanted to.
He then takes 1 Steel from the supply and places it on his mat.
Example 2:Later, Blue wants to visit the Mine. She must stack at least 1 Energy so that her stack is taller than the Worker that’s already occupying the location;she wants to make it difficult for other players, so she stacks 2 Energy under her Worker.
She then takes 1 Steel from the supply and places it on her mat.
Example 3:On a later Work turn, Yellow wants to visit the Mine again. To make the tallest stack, he must make a new stack composed of 1 Worker with at least 3 Energy beneath it;luckily he has enough on his player mat!
He then takes 1 Steel from the supply and places it on his mat.

2. Activate Structures and/or Nation card

You begin with no Structures but will acquire them as the game goes on. For easier management, keep your acquired Structures arranged into three separate tableaus by type: Government, Industry, and Commerce.


ACTIVATING STRUCTURES

You may only activate your own Structures. You may activate as many Structures as your Energy and Workers will allow, as long as the following requirements are met:

e Structure must have an unoccupied action plank. Action planks are found at the bottom of all Structure cards. A plank is unoccupied if no Workers or Energy are currently on it. To activate a card, place Workers and/or Energy on its plank as described to the right:
 e Structure must be of the same type as the location on the main board (Government, Industry, or Commerce) where you placed your Worker this turn. For example if you placed a Worker in a Government location in phase 1, the only Structures you may activate in phase 2 are Government Structures.

You must possess the correct resources to perform the Structure’s action, if it has a Spend arrow

例：In the first phase of his Work turn, Red placed a Worker on the Trade Commerce location of the main board;that means that now he may only activate Commerce Structures (and his Nation card if he wants, see below).

His Airport has a single plank. Red uses an Energy to activate it, placing it on the plank;note that Red must have an Oil barrel available to spend on the Airport’s action. He discards an Oil barrel to the supply and gains $2 and 1 VP.
His Farm has a double plank. Red uses a Worker and an Energy to activate it, placing them both on the plank;he gains $2 and 1 VP.
His Shopping Mall has two single planks. He spends a Worker to activate it once, discarding a Plastic to the supply in exchange for gaining $3.  ere is a second plank available on the card, but Red is not allowed to activate both planks of a two-plank card in the same turn. Perhaps on a later Work turn he’ll have the opportunity! 

ACTIVATING YOUR NATION CARD

Your Nation card functions just like a Structure, except that it may be activated on any Work turn, regardless of which type of location you used on the main board.
As with Structures, you may not activate your Nation card if the plank is already occupied, or if you don’t have the resources available to perform the action.
Activating your Nation card allows you to progress on the United Nations track;see
 e United Nations on page 16 for details.

Once activated, the action of a Structure or Nation card must be carried out. Structures (and/or your Nation card) may be activated in any order. When you are unwilling or unable to activate anything further, your turn is over.

例：Red has an Energy token remaining and decides to activate his Nation card. He places the Energy on the plank, and spends the Oil barrel and $2 to progress on the United Nations track.


A GENERATE TURN

After a few turns of placing Workers and Energy, you’ll run out; time to regroup and generate more Energy! A steady supply of Energy gives you more options, and lets you activate more Structures.

A GENERATE TURN’S PHASES

1. Claim Achievement
2. Return Workers and discard Energy
3. Refine Oil to gain Petroleum dice
4. Roll Energy dice and gain Energy
5. Pollute

1. Claim Achievement

If you have unused Workers + Energy totaling 2 or more remaining on your player mat, you may claim one Achievement. Choose one of the available Achievements on the main board, and place it face down on your player mat. Draw a new Achievement from the supply and place it face up on the main board to replace the one you took.

例：Blue has 2 Energy and 1 Worker left on her player mat, so she may take an Achievement. She takes Oil Production as she thinks will be worth a lot of VP, puts it on her player mat face down, and places a new Achievement from the supply face up in the empty space on the board.

2. Return Workers and discard Energy

Collect all of your in-play Workers from the main board and from your action planks, and return them to your player mat. Discard all your Energy from everywhere—the main board, your action planks, even your player mat—to the supply. You now have no energy.

3. Refine Oil to gain Petroleum dice

To refine an Oil barrel, discard it from your player mat to the general supply. For each Oil barrel you refine, (up to a maximum of 4 per turn) you gain one brown Petroleum Energy die. ese gained Petroleum dice are temporary, and may only be used this turn.

4. Roll Energy dice and gain Energy

You (usually) begin the game with no Energy dice, but you will gain dice as the game progresses. During this phase, you may choose to roll zero or any number or all of your Energy dice to produce Energy, including any temporary Petroleum dice you gained this turn. Roll your chosen dice all at once.
 e results of your rolled dice determine the amount of Energy you gain, and determine if and how you pollute your Environment (see Pollute, below).  e amount of Energy you produce is equal to the total number of Energy symbols displayed on the rolled dice;take that many Energy tokens from your supply and place them on your player mat.
Do not disturb the dice yet;you need to look at them for the next phase, Pollute.

e chart on your player mat shows what each type of die can produce. For example on a roll of 1, a Petroleum die produces 1 Energy. On a roll of 2, 3, 4, or 5, it produces 2 Energy. On a roll of 6, it produces 3 Energy.

例：If you rolled 1 green Solar-wind die, 1 black Coal die, and 2 brown Petroleum dice and got these results, you’d produce 6 Energy. 

5) Pollute

Look at the numbers on your die results.  e die with the highest number is the one that determines what you should do. If more than one die is tied for highest, you choose which one of the tied dice counts as the highest one.
If you did not roll any dice, or if the highest die is a green Solar-wind or a blue Hydro-geo die, your Environment does not get polluted. Take 1 Pollution token from the leftmost spot on the Global Impact track that still has any, and discard it into the general supply.
If the highest die is a black Coal or a brown Petroleum die, your Environment gets polluted.
Take 1 Pollution token from the leftmost spot on the Global Impact track that still has any, and place the token into your Environment, Pollutionside up, on any unpolluted space you choose.
An Environment space is unpolluted if it doesn’t have Pollution, Nuclear Contamination, or an Oil well already in it.
If the highest die is a yellow Nuclear die, your Environment becomes polluted with Nuclear Contamination (which is more difficult to clean up than regular pollution). Take 1 Pollution token from the leftmost spot on the Global Impact track that still has any, and place the token into your Environment, Nuclear Contamination-side up, on any unpolluted space you choose.

例：Your highest die is a Coal die. You take a Pollution token (Pollution side up) and place it in an empty space of your Environment.
例：Your highest die is a Nuclear die. You take a Pollution token and place it (Nuclear Contamination side up) in an empty space of your Environment.

Return any brown Petroleum dice that you rolled back to the supply. All other rolled dice are returned to your mat. 

Here are some examples of different possible dice results for phases 4 and 5:

例：You gain 5 total Energy.  e brown Petroleum die is the highest, so you take 1 Pollution from the Global Impact track and place it in your Environment.  en you discard the brown Petroleum die and return the other dice to your player mat.
例：You gain 6 total Energy.  e green Solar-wind die is the highest, so your Environment does not get polluted;discard 1 Pollution from the Global Impact track into the general supply.  en you return the dice to your player mat.
例：You gain 9 total Energy.
A yellow Nuclear die is the highest, so you gain 1 Nuclear Contamination from the Global Impact track and place it in your Environment.  en you discard both brown Petroleum dice and return the other dice to your player mat.
例：You gain 7 total Energy.  e brown
Petroleum die and the green Solar-wind die are tied for highest, so you get to choose which of them counts as the highest. Not wanting to pollute, you pick the Solar-wind die. You discard 1 Pollution from the Global Impact track into the general supply.  en you discard the brown Petroleum die and return the other dice to your player mat.


YOUR ENVIRONMENT

Your nation’s Environment is represented by a grid of three rows (Air, Forest, and Ocean) on your player mat. You begin the game with one Pollution token in your Air row, but as the game progresses, you will likely be adding Pollution, Nuclear Contamination, and Oil Wells to the grid.

Each space of your grid can hold a single token. When a space is occupied by a token of any kind, it is considered to be polluted.
An empty space in your grid is considered to be unpolluted.
 e column bonuses in the top right indicate bonus VP won at the end of the game if the respective full column is unpolluted.

GAINING POLLUTION AND NUCLEAR CONTAMINATION

Pollution is gained mostly from rolling Energy dice and from acquiring Structures (see Gaining a new Structure on page 14 for details), but there are a few other ways you might gain pollution as well. Unless otherwise instructed, when you gain a Pollution token (regardless of whether it is Pollution or Nuclear Contamination), take the token from the leftmost spot on the Global Impact track that still has any, and add it to your Environment with the correct side up. Once placed, tokens in your Environment may not be rearranged.
Unless specifically instructed to place the token in a particular row of your Environment, you may place a gained Pollution token in any unpolluted space.
Sometimes, you will be instructed to gain Pollution in a particular row. In that case, you may place the token in any unpolluted space in that row.

ese are the symbols, found on some Structure cards and elsewhere, that indicate you should add Pollution or Nuclear Contamination to a specific row of your Environment.

If you are instructed to place a Pollution token into a specific row of your Environment that is already full, place that token instead into any unpolluted space in your Environment.

If you gain a Pollution token, but have no unpolluted spaces remaining in your Environment, discard that token to the supply

例：When you acquire this Chemical
Plant, the card tells you to gain Pollution in your Ocean row. You’d take a token from the leftmost spot on the Global Impact track and place it in your Ocean row with the Pollution side up


CLEANUP

Although you may not rearrange tokens in your Environment, there is a way to remove them. e cleanup symbol appears on the Clean Up location on the main board, and also on several Structures that you might acquire. For each cleanup symbol you activate, you may choose one of these actions to perform:

Remove a Pollution token (Pollution-side up only, not Nuclear Contamination) from any space of your Environment, and return it to the general supply.
Remove one Oil Well token from your Environment and return it to the general supply. (See the Oil Drilling section on page 15 for more details about Oil Wells.)
Choose one Nuclear Contamination token in your
Environment and flip it over to become Pollution.  e token must stay in the same space of your Environment.

THE GLOBAL IMPACT TRACK

e Global Impact track is a timeline for the game. During the game, Pollution tokens will steadily be removed from the leftmost spot that still has any. When a spot first becomes empty of tokens, a new Global Impact is triggered and a new price of Oil comes into effect.

TRIGGERING A GLOBAL IMPACT

e current player finishes resolving the action they are performing (not their entire turn). If there is a face up Global Impact card remaining from an earlier triggering, discard it. Reveal the leftmost Global Impact card from the row of face down cards below the main board, and carry out its effects. (See below for details.) After carrying out the Global Impact card, the current player continues the rest of their turn.


例：e final
Pollution token has just been removed from a spot on the Global Impact track;it is the second spot that has emptied in this game.
We discard the old face up Global Impact card from the previous triggering, and reveal the next face down one.

is is the “peek at an upcoming Global Impact” symbol. It is found on the Scientific Research location on the main board, and also on several Structure cards. When you activate this symbol, you may peek at one face down Global Impact card of your choice along the bottom of the main board. Knowing which Global Impacts are approaching can be a great advantage!

CARRYING OUT A GLOBAL IMPACT

Each Global Impact card is divided into three parts.
Global Impact cards affect all players, not just the active player. Resolve the card’s three parts in this order:

e Environment row that will be scored. (See Scoring Environment Rows on the next page.)
 e Structure market that will be reset. (See Resetting Structure Markets on the next page.)
 e special effect of the card.
Each Global Impact card has a unique special effect. Read the card out loud and follow its instructions. Some cards have an immediate effect, and some cards have a persistent effect that lasts until the next Global Impact card is triggered.

例：A new Global Impact has been triggered and it is this Chemical Spill card. We resolve in order:
Each player scores the Air row of their own Environment.
We read out the special effect and do what it says. For this card, each player takes two Pollution tokens from the supply, chooses one row of their own Environment with sufficient space, and places both of the tokens in that row.


OIL PRICES

e price of Oil is always the value showing beneath the leftmost spot on the Global Impact track that still has any tokens in it.  at value equals the price of 1 barrel of Oil.
At the beginning of the game, the price of Oil is therefore $1 per barrel.

例：It is well into the game and several spots on the Global Impact track have emptied.  e price of Oil is currently $3 per barrel.


ENDGAME TRIGGER

When the last Pollution token is removed from the last (rightmost) spot on the Global Impact track, this triggers the end of the game (in addition to triggering a Global Impact as usual). See Endgame and Scoring for details.


SCORING ENVIRONMENT ROWS

A triggered Global Impact card causes all players to score a particular Environment row, indicating which row with one of these icons:

When scoring a row, each player gains 1 VP for each unpolluted space in the indicated row. A space is unpolluted if it holds no tokens of any kind.

例：Based on the Environment above, this player would earn 4 VP if her Air row were scored, or 2 VP if her Forest row were scored, or 1 VP if her Ocean row were scored.


RESETTING STRUCTURE MARKETS

A triggered Global Impact card also causes one of the three Structure markets to be reset, indicating which market with one of these icons: 

To reset a market simply discard all of the Structures in the indicated market, and draw new Structures of the appropriate type to replace them, filling in from right to left.

If a Structure card deck ever runs out while resetting, shuffle its discard pile and form a new Structure deck.

例：Our Global Impact card instructs us to reset the Commerce market. We discard all three Commerce structures currently in the market, and replace them from right to left with new cards drawn from the Structure deck.

GAME PIECES ON LOCATIONS

Some Global Impact cards instruct you to place game pieces such as resources or Pollution tokens on main board locations. ese are taken from the supply and then placed on the board in the indicated locations.

If you place a Worker in a location which contains any resources or tokens, you immediately gain all of the resources and/or tokens in that location, before resolving the action. 

Note that you may use that resource immediately to pay a cost associated with that placement, and this may also fulfill the requirement for being able to use that location.

例：e Cheap Imports Global Impact card causes 1 Plastic to be placed on each Commerce location.  e next player who uses each of these locations will be able to collect the 1 Plastic before carrying out the action. For example a player may go to the Commerce market, collect the Plastic, then use that Plastic to purchase a Structure.


LOCATIONS

You begin a Work turn by selecting from the thirteen locations on the main board.  ese locations enable you to carry out a variety of actions to build your empire.  ey are arranged into three types:
Government, Industry, and Commerce.  e Government locations are the four located on the green binder to the left, the Industry locations are the five located on the brown binder in the middle, and the Commerce locations are the four located on the yellow binder to the right. Remember, the location you visit on the main board determines the type of your own Structures you may use on that turn.


MARKETS

ere is a Structure market for each type;Government, Industry, and Commerce. Placing a Worker in one of the three Structure markets allows you to buy one of the three Structures in that market.
After you have placed a Worker in a market location, indicate which Structure you wish to build, then pay the cost for that Structure depending on which spot in the market the Structure occupies;the cost is shown right above the card, and can be paid with either money or with resources (but not a combination of the two). Spent money or spent resources are discarded into the general supply.

Gaining a new Structure

Once you have paid for a Structure, take it and place it in your tableau. (Keep your Government, Industry, and Commerce Structures separated for easy management.)  e new Structure is available to be used immediately.
Each Structure card has a VP value.  ese VP are added to your score at the end of the game.
Some Structures also have a symbol indicating
Pollution or Nuclear Contamination.  is token is gained one time:immediately when you gain the card. Take a Pollution token from the leftmost spot of the Global Impact track that still has any, and add it to the indicated row of your Environment with the correct side up.


Refilling the market

Any time a card is removed from a market, immediately slide the remaining cards in that market to the left to fill in the empty space, then draw a new card from the appropriate deck and place it in the rightmost space of the market.

f a Structure card deck ever runs out while refilling, shuffle its discard pile and form a new Structure deck.

例：You have just purchased the Airport;
You place it in your Commerce tableau.

You will earn 4VP for it at the end of the game.
 is card has a symbol on it that indicates you must pollute your Air row;you take a token from the leftmost stack on the Global Impact track and add it to your Environment in the Air row.
 e action plank of this structure is now available for use.

例：After purchasing the Airport from the middle space in the Commerce market, you slide the Farm to the left, and draw a new card from the Commerce Structure deck to fill the blank space on the right.


OTHER GOVERNMENT LOCATIONS


SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH

Gain 1 Science from the general supply. en peek at one face down Global Impact card of your choice, being careful not to reveal the card to other players. Return the card to the same position.


EDUCATI

Spend $3 to gain 1 Worker of your player color and place it on your player mat;the new Worker is available immediately for use.
Also, gain 1 Pollution from the leftmost spot of the Global Impact track that still has any and place it in your Environment. 


CLEAN UP

Spend 1 Science to perform two Cleanup actions. (See Cleanup on page 11 for details)


OTHER INDUSTRY LOCATIONS


MINE

Gain 1 Steel from the general supply.


OIL DRILLING

Take 1 Oil Well token from the supply, and place it in your Environment.  en gain three Oil barrels from the supply.
An Oil Well may only be placed in an unpolluted space marked by the Drilling symbol. ( ere are four such spaces in your Environment.) If no such space is available, you may not drill for Oil.

e Oil Well tokens have an Oil Derrick on the front and an Oil Rig on the back. It doesn’t affect gameplay, but it’s nice to use the Derrick in the Forest row and the Rig in the Ocean row!

chemistry

Spend 1 Oil to gain 2 Plastic, 1 Science, and gain 1 Pollution from the leftmost spot of the Global Impact track that still has any and place it in your Environment.


POWER PLANT

Spend the displayed resources to gain one Energy die, and place the die on your player mat. Dice are limited to the available supply. ese dice are kept permanently, and may be used on each Generate turn.


Gaining Energy dice

You are limited to owning 5 Energy dice at a time. (ere are 5 slots on the right edge of your player mat to hold your dice.) Temporary Petroleum dice are not placed in those slots and do not count towards that limit. You may discard any Energy die back to the supply at any time, to make room for obtaining a new different one. Dice are worth victory points at the end of the game (See Endgame and Scoring on page 20 for details.)

e Hydro-geo die

You are limited to one blue Hydro-geo die. When you gain a Hydro-geo die, you must also take one Pollution token from the leftmost spot of the Global Impact track that still has any and place it in the Forest row of your Environment.


OTHER COMMERCE LOCATIONS


FINANCE
Choose one of the following three options:
• Gain $2
• Gain $3, each opponent gains $1
• Gain $4, each opponent gains $2


BUY/SELL OIL
Make only a single exchange. Choose one:
• Spend money equal to the current price of Oil to gain 3 Oil barrels.
• Return 3 Oil barrels to the supply to gain money equal to the current price of Oil.


TRADE
Make any number of exchanges between yourself and the general supply. Resources eligible for trade are $2, Steel, Plastic, and Science.
For example, you may trade $2 and 2 Science for 2 Steel and 1 Plastic.


THE UNITED NATIONS

As described in Activating Your Nation Card on page 8, you may use your Nation card in the same way you would use a Structure.  e Nation card ability allows you to spend the indicated resources to move your player marker one space to the right on the United Nations track on the main board.
At the end of the game, you receive the victory points indicated at the top of the column occupied by your marker. In addition, there is a leader bonus of 3 VP for the player who has moved the farthest on track.  is leader bonus is split between players tied for furthest (see Ending the Game and Scoring on page 20 for details).
Player markers may occupy the same spaces on the track, except for the last space, which may only be occupied by one marker. (Once a player has moved into that space, no player on the previous space may advance.)

例：Red has activated his Nation card with an Energy token, and has spent the required 1 Oil barrel and $2. He moves his marker one space to the right on the United Nations track, ending up in the same space as Green. If Red finishes the game in this space, he’ll earn the 12 VP displayed at the top of the column.
If the game were to end with the markers in these positions, Red and Green would split the 3VP leader bonus, rounding down to 1 VP each.


SOME GENERAL RULES


DERSTANDING STRUCTURES
Obtaining and using Structures well is vital to building your energy empire.
Each Structure has several common characteristics described here.


STRUCTURE TYPE

Tells you whether a Structure is Government, Industry, or Commerce.


VP VALUE
Tells you how many Victory
Points you receive at the end of the game for owning this Structure card.


POLLUTION TYPE

GAINING VICTORY POINTS

Whenever you gain VP, advance your player marker on the Score track by that many spaces. (Note that some VP are scored immediately and some are scored at the game’s end.)


GAINING RESOURCES
Unless otherwise specified, whenever any aspect of the game instructs you to gain any resource, take the appropriate amount of that resource from the general supply and store it in the appropriate section of your player mat. 


STAYING ORGANIZED

It is important that you keep all of your assets (resources, Workers, Energy, Energy dice, and Achievements) properly stored on your player mat. is will help limit confusion during the game about which assets are legitimately owned and in play.


ACHIEVEMENTS
Achievement tokens provide a way to make use of surplus Energy or Workers with the potential to gain additional VP. You begin the game with one Achievement and may claim one additional Achievement each time you begin a Generate turn with at least 2 Workers/Energy left over (see Claim Achievement on page 9).
You are limited to owning a maximum of five Achievements at any one time. However, you may discard any Achievement at any time to make room for a new one. (Discarded Achievements are removed from the game.) Keep your Achievements face down on your player mat until the end of the game;you may peek at your own Achievements whenever you want.
Achievements provide VP to their owners at the end of the game as described on the tiles.
Each Achievement has a maximum value of 5 VP. ( is simply means that if you merit more than 5VP according to the Achievement, earn 5VP instead.)
