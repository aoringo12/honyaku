Clockwork Wars
It is a time of civil war and chaos. The hybrid races have cast off their chains of subjugation and are embroiled in a desperate battle for independence and state supremacy. Environmental destruction from years of war has led to a world of limited natural resources, food shortages, and desperation.


イントロダクション

In Clockwork Wars, 2-4 players command a unique race of creatures in a tense war game set in a fantasy-steampunk universe.
Take control of the calculating Purebreeds, the industrious Troglodytes, the mighty Rhinochs, or the proud Mongrels. Your goal is to vanquish your foes and accumulate the most victory points through seven turns of play. You earn points by fighting for control of territories that contain valuable natural resources. To win these battles, you need manpower gained by seizing villages and developing them into cities. Invest in research and discover astonishing new technologies, like Golems, Analytical Engines, and the wondrous Spire of the Gods. Position your troops, research powerful discoveries, employ espionage, and conquer your enemies to win the game!

The Races

Purebreeds (red):Centuries ago, human scientists created the hybrid races through a combination of genetic engineering and arcane wizardry.
Outraged by this act of hubris, many civilians flocked to the priests who pronounced all hybrids an affront to God. The “Purebreeds” are dogmatic and militaristic humans who devoutly believe in their own genetic superiority. They want nothing more than to conquer the hybrids and suppress their rebellion. Their infantry don steam-powered armor in combat and can wield both sorcery and firearms with equal aptitude. The Purebreeds’ unique unit is the Operative – a master of nefarious, covert operations.

Troglodytes (blue): Trogs are human-chimpanzee hybrids. They are bright, curious, and resourceful – interested in experimentation and the development of new technology. Due to infighting and distractibility, Troglodyte society tends to be volatile, and their villages are little more than junkyards. But in war, Trogs attack in overwhelming numbers and possess extraordinary cunning and tactical ability. The Trogs’ unique unit is the Engineer – a brilliant researcher, adept in sorcery, science, and mysticism.

Rhinochs (white): Rhinochs are human-rhinoceros hybrids. Originally engineered by humans to serve as slaves for all forms of physical labor, the Rhinochs possess a deep hatred for the Purebreeds. They are fierce warriors, capable of valor and heroism in the face of insurmountable odds. A Rhinoch infantryman typically wields an enormous mace in one hand and a Gatling gun in the other. Their unique unit is the Crasher – a humongous berserk Rhinoch used as a devastating siege engine.

Mongrels (green): Mongrels are human-dog hybrids. Their fierce loyalty and sociality has led to a strong, interdependent society where discipline and dignity guide cultural progress. They are skilled spies and assassins, and utilize guerilla tactics instead of engaging enemies openly in large numbers. Their soldiers prefer blades and daggers to guns, which they consider vulgar and uncomfortably loud. In battle, their savage instincts and lightning reflexes make them formidable enemies. Their unique unit is the Hunter – a lone commando unit seemingly capable of appearing and disappearing at will.


セットアップ
各プレイヤーはランダムか選択で4つの種族のうち1つを選び、その後、選択した種族に一致するスクリーン、30個の木製ディスク、独自ユニットトークンを取ります。これらが対戦相手に見えるように、自身のスクリーンの横に配置します。あなたのワーカーを表す木製ディスクの山は、リザーブと称されます（ゲームには各プレイヤー2つの余分なディスクがあることに注意してください―これらはリザーブの一部ではありません）。各プレイヤーはまた、展開オーダーパットからシート1枚を必要とします。
テーブル中央にマップを構築します。プレイヤー人数に合わせて、ルールブックの後ろにある、マップを作成する方法を参照してください。
ディスカバリーカードを、カード5枚ごと、9つのデッキに分けます。各デッキは特定時代の、特定分野1つのディスカバリーカードで構成されます―魔法学、科学、宗教学それぞれの、早期、中期、後期デッキ。これらデッキをシャッフルします。各デッキから1枚のカードを表向きで、3☓3のグリッドになるように配置します―早期ディスカバリーで上の行、中期で中の行、後期で下の行を形成します。これら9つのディスカバリーがゲームで利用可能です―残りをゲームボックスに戻します。各カードに一致するディスカバリートークンを探し、プラスチックスタンドを使用してそのカードに配置します。
マップ近くに将軍カードとミニチュアを配置します。
影響ポイント（IP）を分野ごとに分け、マップ横に全てのプレイヤーの手がとどくように配置します。各プレイヤーは各分野から1IPを取り、自身のスクリーン裏に配置します。
マップの横にゲームボードを配置します。プレイしたいゲームタイプを選択し、それに一致するようにゲームボードの面を上にします。基本ゲーム[または]エピックゲーム（エピックゲームヴァリアントはページ19を参照）。諜報アイコンのある6つの空きスペースに、スパイマスターアクションタイルを配置します。ターントラックの最初のスペースにターントークンを配置します。スコアトラックの横にプレイヤーのスコアマーカーを配置します。
諜報カードをシャッフルし、各プレイヤーに1枚ずつ配ります。残ったカードはゲームボードの横に、裏向きで配置します。
プレイで使用する法廷を1つ選択し、マップの横に配置します。各プレイヤーは自身のリザーブからワーカー1つを、法廷に直ちに配置します。
最も時を過ごしたプレイヤーがファーストプレイヤートークンを受け取ります。プレイの準備が整いました！

マップと地域
クロックウォーズは無限に繰り返せるようモジュラーボードを使用します。マップは9つの地域タイプによる、色分けされた六角形タイルで構成されます。

首都：あなたの種族の首都です。首都は攻撃されません。
村（オレンジ）：ワーカーを雇用するために使用します。
3体以上のユニットに制御された場合、都市にアップグレードできます。
要塞（青灰）：駐留ユニットは隣接戦闘を増強するために使用できます。
湖と森（青と緑）：
リソース地域です。得点フェイズ時にこれらを制御していた場合、VPを得ます。
研究地域。影響ポイント（IP）を産出するために使用します。

 
塔（赤）：魔法学IPを生成します。
工房（灰）：科学IPを生成します。
神殿（金）：宗教学IPを生成します。
荒れ地（茶）：荒れ地に関連した特別なルールは特にありません。これらはユニットにより制御され、軍隊への供給を維持できますが、他に効果はありません。

地域タイルは両面です。クロックウォーズのゲームでどちらの面を使用するか好みで決定してください。片面は鳥から見たようなリアルな絵で描かれています。もう片方はその地域タイプを連想させるアイコンと色による抽象的なものになっています。

マップはこれら9つの地域タイプに加えて、マップ外に展開できる法廷があります。これは強大な領主の宮廷裁判所を表します。スパイと法廷を制御すると、特別ボーナスと勝利点を獲得できます。
ルールブックの後ろに、2-4プレイヤーゲームのためにサンプルマップがいくつか掲載されています。ただし、クロックウォーズは自身でマップを作成するのが最も楽しいです。マップを作成する方法もまた含まれています。


3つの時代
クロックウォーズのゲームは紛争の続いた数世紀をプレイします。
ターンは3つの時代に分けられます：
ターン1～2は早期を。
ターン3～4は中期を。
ターン5～7は後期を。
時代はゲームプレイに2つの影響を持ちます：
研究で現在利用可能なディスカバリーを決定します。あなたが研究できるディスカバリーは、現在[または]以前の時代のものになります。例えば、ターン4時（中期）、あなたは初期と中期のディスカバリーのみ購入できます―後期ディスカバリーはターン5まで利用不可能です。
各時代の終わりに、得点フェイズを行います。ゲームの目的
最終得点フェイズの終わりに最も勝利点（VP）を持つプレイヤーがゲームに勝利します。VPは主にリソース地域を制御することで得ますが、いくつかのディスカバリーの使用やゲーム終了時の影響ポイント（IP）との交換によっても得ることができます。制御とユニット
制御のコンセプトはクロックウォーズのコアです。マップの地域は、その地域にあなたのユニットのみが居る時に制御できます。法廷は、ほかプレイヤーよりもあなたのスパイが多い時に制御できます。
ユニットに含まれる：兵士、独自ユニット、将軍。 

ターンシークエンス
クロックウォーズのゲームは7ターン行われます。各ターンは5つのフェイズに分割されます。ターン2，4、7の終わりに、得点フェイズと呼ばれる追加のフェイズがあります。
スパイマスターフェイズ：ファーストプレイヤーから始まり、各プレイヤーはスパイマスターアクション1つを選択します。
雇用フェイズ：プレイヤーたちは同時に、自身の持つディスカバリー効果を適用して首都、村、都市それぞれからワーカーたちを雇用します。
展開フェイズ：プレイヤーたちは同時に、そして秘密裏に、自身の展開オーダーを記入します。プレイヤー全員がそれを終えると、自身のオーダーを公開し、その後、マップにユニットを配置します。
戦闘フェイズ：このフェイズは3つのステージへと、さらに分割されます：•	増強：要塞は隣接戦闘に追加のユニットを送るために使用できます。いくつかのディスカバリーが使用できます。•	戦闘それぞれの戦闘が解決されます。•	消耗：供給のない地形それぞれから、一体のユニットが取り除かれなければなりません。
研究フェイズ：このフェイズは3つのステージへと、さらに分割されます：•	研究：影響ポイント（IP）が3つの研究分野ごとに生成されます。•	ディスカバリー：プレイヤーたちはディスカバリーと将軍を購入します。•	発動：プレイヤーたちは特定のディスカバリーを発動します。
得点フェイズ：ターン2、4，7の終わりに、プレイヤーたちは3つのステージさらに別れる得点フェイズを行います。•	勝利点：プレイヤーたちは自身が制御するリソース地域と所有するディスカバリーから、VPを受け取ります。•	法廷の優位性：1人のプレイヤーが法廷を制御している場合、そのプレイヤーがボーナスを受け取ります。•	汚染：全てのリソース地域のユニットの数を1に減少させなければなりません。スパイマスターフェイズ
スパイマスターフェイズ時、あなたはこのターンのみ効果が適応される特別アクション1つを選択します。
アクションが選択されると、他プレイヤーはそれを選択することはできません。ファーストプレイヤートークンを所持するプレイヤーが最初にアクションを選択し、テーブルを時計回りでこれを続けます。アクションを選択するには、ゲームボードからスパイマスターアクションタイルを1つとり、自身の前にこれを配置します。あなたは次のアクションの1つを選択できます：
支配：自身の雇用プールにワーカー1体を直ちに追加します（自身のリザーブから取って）。
先手：直ちに、マップのユニット2体を、自身が制御するそれぞれ異なる地形へと移動させることができます（法廷は含まれません）。
R&D：諜報デッキから諜報カード2枚をドローし、1枚を保持し、もう1枚をデッキの下に入れます。

防諜：あなたは任意の研究分野の1IPを得て、任意の対戦相手たち（全員も可）へと任意の研究分野の1IPを失わせることができます。
技術狂い：このターン、あなたは研究フェイズの各ステージで最初に行動します。さらに、直ちに1VPを得ます。
戦術作戦：このターンの戦闘ステージ時、あなたが最大軍事力でタイの戦闘全てで、+1のボーナスを得てあなたが戦闘に勝利します。雇用フェイズ
雇用フェイズ時、あなたはワーカーを集めます。各木製ディスクはワーカー1体を表します。
首都は4ワーカー雇用します。
あなたが制御する村は1ワーカーを雇用します。
あなたが制御する都市は2ワーカーを雇用します。•	村は、少なくとも3体のユニットでそこを制御する場合に、都市になります。•	都市は、そこを制御するユニットが2体以下になると直ちに村に戻ります。
自身のリザーブから、自身の雇用プールへとディスクを送ります。これは自身のスクリーンの裏に隠します。
リザーブに十分なディスクを持っていない場合、人口上限（30）に到達しました。この上限を越えてワーカーを得ることはできません。

例：雇用
ターン5です。雇用フェイズの開始時にて、チャールズは1村と2都市を制御しています。首都とともに、彼は合計9ワーカーを雇用できます。

展開フェイズ
In the Deployment Phase, you decide if you want to assign any of your workers to territories on the map or the Court.
In addition, you may decide to deploy one of your race’s Unique Units (see page 17). The most important aspect of this process is that each player makes their deployment decisions secretly. You do not place workers directly onto the map. Instead, you record your deployment orders on a sheet of paper (a deployment-orders pad is included in the game). Every map tile and Court is labeled with an I.D. tag (e.g., L1). To record a deployment order, you simply write down the I.D. of the tile or Court that you wish to deploy units to and the number and type of units you wish to deploy there. There is no limit to the number of workers that can be deployed to a single territory or Court.

You can choose to keep some workers in your recruitment pool and not give them deployment orders. During the Research Phase, these workers can be sacrificed for additional IPs. You may also save workers for use on future turns.
When making deployment decisions, you must take into account the territories on the map that you and your opponents control. You always control your Capital and never need to deploy units to it.
You may only deploy units to a territory that... you currently control, or is adjacent to a territory that you control, or is 2 tiles away from a territory that you control, if the intervening territory is currently unoccupied (the Forced March rule). w You must deploy at least one unit to the intervening territory when conducting a Forced March. w You may Force March to multiple target territories (using a single intervening territory, or different intervening territories).
You may always deploy workers to a Court.
Each player should announce when he has finished his deployment decisions. Once all players have finished, they drop their play screens and reveal their respective deployment orders.
At this point, you can transfer your workers and Unique Units from your recruitment pool to the territories on the map and the Court. Although players may do this simultaneously, it can become a bit chaotic;therefore, it is recommended that each player deploy their units in turn, starting with the first player.

Once a worker is placed onto a map territory, it is called a Soldier. A worker placed onto a Court is called a Spy.
Units deployed on to the map may not be moved during the deployment phase, although special actions such as the Spymaster action, Gambit, or reinforcement from a citadel may allow a unit to move. Removing a unit from the map is also prohibited, except as a result of death in combat or from a specific card effect. Therefore, the decisions you make during the Deployment phase are of vital importance. Once all players have transferred units to the map and Court, they should assess the new gamestate.
If a player has sole possession of a territory, he is in control of it. If two or more players have units in the same territory, it is contested and a battle results. 2 Combat Phase During the Combat Phase, all battles will be resolved.
Battles result when units of two or more races occupy the same map territory. The Combat Phase is sub-divided into three stages:the Reinforcement stage, the Battle stage, and the Attrition stage.

Reinforcement Stage
Reinforcement orders should take place in a sequence, beginning with the player who has the first player token.
During your Reinforcement stage, you can make as many reinforcement orders as you wish.

Possible reinforcement orders:
If you control any Citadels, you may use them to reinforce adjacent battles.
Any Soldiers in Citadels that are not currently contested may move to an adjacent territory where a battle is occurring.
You may use Discoveries (like the Dirigible) that activate during the Reinforcement stage.
You may play certain Espionage cards (like Ambush).
Finally, three Unique Units can be used during the Reinforcement stage:w The Hunter can reinforce any battle within 2 tiles of it. w The Crasher activates to instantly kill up to 3 opposing Soldiers.

Understanding the Forced March rule is vital to your success in Clockwork Wars. Here are a couple examples:
To the right is a representation of the map on Turn 1 of a new game. Charles’ Capital is marked with a “C”. In his Recruitment Phase, he added 4 workers to his recruitment pool. He is now deciding where to deploy them. The territories shown are all the ones that he could reach on this first turn. Only the Lake and Forest are adjacent to territories he currently controls (his Capital). However, he could do a Forced March into any of the territories marked
“FM.” Perhaps his best move would be to deploy a single worker to the Forest and use that to Force March at least 1 worker into the Village.
Here is another example from later in that same game.
Charles (blue) is again considering his deployment. Even though he would like to Force March some workers into the uncontrolled Citadel, he cannot. His opponent, Jules (white), controls the Shrine in between. Charles can Force March into the unoccupied Village, if he also deploys at least 1 worker to the intervening Tower. Charles could also conduct a Forced March to attack the Village that Jules currently controls.

If the Operative is in contested territory with just a single enemy Soldier, you may have the Operative kill the opposing Soldier. w Unique Units are discussed in detail on page 17.
Once the first player has finished all her reinforcement orders, she must declare a “pass.” After a player passes, she cannot make any further reinforcement orders that turn. The next player in turn sequence can now make reinforcement orders. It is possible that one of your opponents, earlier in turn order, kills all your units in a contested tile during their Reinforcement stage (through use of a Unique Unit, for example). However, battles are not resolved until the Battle stage. Therefore, you are still allowed to reinforce this tile when it is your turn.
Once all players have completed their reinforcement orders, the Reinforcement stage ends.

Battle Stage
The first player resolves all his battles first. He may determine the order in which these battles are resolved.
Play then progresses clockwise to the next player. To resolve a battle, each player involved totals the number of Soldiers he has in the territory. This is called Army Strength.
Most Unique Units and the Steamtank general also contribute to Army Strength.
Some Discoveries add bonuses to Army Strength (for example, Power Armor adds +1 to Army Strength).
The player with the greatest total Army Strength wins the battle.
The losers of a battle must remove all their units from the territory - these units are considered killed.
Killed Soldiers are always returned to their owners’ reserves.
Killed Unique Units and a defeated Steamtank general are removed from the game.
The winner of a battle gets to keep a number of his units in the territory equal to the difference between the two greatest Army Strengths. The remainder of his units are killed.
The winner of the battle now controls the territory. A player “wins” a battle only if he is the sole player with the highest Army Strength;a player “loses” a battle if another player has been declared the winner.
If two or more players are tied for the greatest Army Strength, then all units involved in the battle are killed and the territory is left unoccupied. The battle is considered a draw.

例外：If you took the Tactical Ops action during the Spymaster Phase, you receive an additional +1 bonus to Army Strength in tied battles and therefore emerge victorious!

例：Reinforcement & Combat
Charles (blue), Jules (white), and Ada (green) are battling over a Village located between 2 Citadels. Charles deployed 1 Soldier to the Village in the previous phase, while Jules and Ada deployed 2 each. It is now the Combat Phase and they need to make some decisions regarding reinforcement.
Charles possesses the first-player token, and so will make his reinforcement orders first. He decides to send 2 of his Soldiers from the adjacent Citadel to help out in the battle.
He now has a C3-J2-A2 advantage in Army Strength. He passes.
Jules’ turn is next. He possesses the Dragonflame
Discovery, which allows him to kill one opposing Soldier in combat during the Reinforcement stage. He decides to use this Discovery now and remove one of Charles’
Soldiers. He also decides to transfer his Citadel Soldier into the battle. Now, Jules has the advantage:C2-J3-A2. He passes.
It is Ada’s turn, and she does not have any reinforcement orders to give. She passes. The Reinforcement stage is over and the battle is resolved. Both Charles and Ada lose their 2 Soldiers. One of Jules’ Soldiers remains on the Village and gives him control of the territory. Jules is considered the “winner” and both Charles and Ada are “losers.”


Attrition Stage
Attrition refers to a weakening of forces due to constant harassment or weak supply lines. Clockwork Wars uses a simple mechanism to model the costs of attrition.
During the Attrition stage, you must check to see if you control any territories that are not linked to either your Capital or a City that you currently control, via a connected series of controlled territories.
Disconnected territories are considered to be outof- supply.
You must remove one unit from every out-of-supply territory.
The Guardian and Steamtank generals and the Operative Unique Unit are not affected by attrition.

Combat Strategy
Combat strategy in Clockwork Wars has a lot to do with guessing where your opponent is going to deploy units. You can choose to meet them on the field of battle with a (hopefully) larger force, or attack other poorly defended territories.
Remember that your opponent is trying to guess where you’ll place your units!Try not to be predictable. Surprise attacks can be very effective.
Instead of committing several Soldiers to a territory where you expect a large battle to occur (an unoccupied Village, for example), consider attacking a weakly defended link in your opponent’s supply chain. If you plan things right, you could force attrition losses in several territories with just a single, strategically deployed Soldier.
In 3 and 4 player games, feel free to negotiate with your neighbors. Maybe you want to declare a temporary peace treaty so that you’re not fighting on multiple fronts. However, no promises are binding, so beware of betrayal!


例：Attrition
The map section below shows a Combat Phase in progress. Every territory that Jules (white) controls is shown. Seeing a weakness in Jules’ supply chain, Charles (blue) has struck at the Tower adjacent to Jules’ Capital.
Jules will not only lose this battle (C3 vs. J2) but after it is resolved, all of his controlled territories to the southwest of the Tower (shown circled) will be out-of-supply. Thus, he will have to remove the lone Soldier on each of these territories during the Attrition stage, forfeiting this entire section of the map. A powerful move by Charles and one that Jules should have seen coming!If he had developed his southern Village into a City, this scenario would have been averted.


Research Phase
Research is a central feature of gameplay in Clockwork Wars.
The right combination of Discoveries can give you that edge you need to defeat your opponent on the field of battle and in the struggle for VPs. Every game of Clockwork Wars has a different set of Discoveries available for research. There are three different disciplines of research that you can pursue:
Sorcery, Science, and Religion. For each of these disciplines, there are 3 different Discoveries corresponding to the 3 Ages of the game. Early Age Discoveries tend to cost less and be less powerful than Middle Age and Late Age Discoveries.

Research Areas
Sorcery: Sorcery discoveries are typically the most expensive and powerful in the game. They often let you do direct damage to your opponents, killing their Soldiers at no risk to your own.

Science:Science discoveries can increase your recruitment, enhance your Army Strength, or provide you with additional means of generating VPs. Useful in many circumstances!
Religion:Religion discoveries are the most affordable, typically costing fewer than 5 IPs. Many are defensive in nature or allow you to take further advantage of Villages, Cities, and Shrines.
There are 3 stages to the Research Phase:the Study stage, the Discovery stage, and the Activation stage.

Study Stage
You generate Influence Points (IPs) during this stage.
For every Tower that you control, gain 1 Sorcery IP.
For every Manufactory that you control, gain 1

Science IP.
For every Shrine that you control, gain 1 Religion IP.
Use the included IP tokens to represent your stockpile.
Players can collect their IP tokens simultaneously. You should hide your IP tokens behind your screen.
During this stage, you can also sacrifice workers in your recruitment pool (those that were not deployed this turn) for additional IPs. For each worker you return to your reserve, you gain 1 IP in any research discipline.

Discovery Stage
Once all players have finished gathering IPs, they move to the Discovery stage. At this point, players take turns purchasing available Discoveries and Generals. As during the Reinforcement stage, first choice goes to the player with the first-player token and then rotates clockwise.
例外：If a player took the Technophilia action during the Spymaster Phase, then she gets to choose the first Discovery. Play then progresses in clockwise order from this player.
The first player may purchase one Discovery/General or “pass” (not purchase anything).
Once a player passes, her Discovery stage is over.
The next player then may purchase or pass.
You can purchase more than 1 Discovery/General during this stage;however, you must wait until every other player has had a chance to purchase something before you can purchase another Discovery/General.
Play continues in this fashion until all players have passed.
Only those Discoveries of the current age and earlier ages are available for purchase. Once you purchase a Discovery, place the card face-up in front of your screen.
Each Discovery card costs a certain number of IPs within a specific discipline. For example, Alchemy (shown below) is an Early Age discovery that costs 3 Science IPs. You must discard the required number of IP tokens to purchase the Discovery.

Every Discovery provides a unique benefit to the player who owns it. You can think of Discoveries as cards that
“break” the rules. When there is a conflict between the rulebook and the text of a Discovery card, the Discovery card takes precedence.
Discoveries must be linked to specific territories on the map through the use of Discovery tokens:
When you purchase a Discovery card, you also take a matching Discovery token.
That token must be placed on either your Capital or a research territory that you control that matches the discipline of the Discovery (for example, the Alchemy token must be placed on a Manufactory or your Capital).

A given territory, including a Capital, can only hold one Discovery token.
Once placed, a Discovery token cannot be moved to another territory.
If you do not control a legal territory to place a Discovery token, you cannot purchase the Discovery.
If a player captures a territory that has a Discovery token through combat, she gains control of the Discovery and takes the card from the losing player. This transfer of ownership occurs at the end of the Battle stage. Note that when a territory is contested (as at the end of a Deployment Phase), ownership of a Discovery is not affected.

例：Discovery ownership
Jules owns the Juggernaut discovery and has placed its token on a manufactory under his control. On the next turn, Charles deploys units to this manufactory, attacking it. Even though the territory is now contested, Jules still owns the Juggernaut. During the Reinforcement stage of the Combat Phase, Jules activates the Juggernaut to kill 3 of Charles’ Soldiers within range. However, Charles wins the battle for the manufactory and takes control of the Juggernaut at the end of the Battle stage. (Note:Since ownership has changed hands, Charles is allowed to activate the Juggernaut during this turn’s Activation stage.)
If a Discovery token is ever on a territory that does not contain any units, it is not owned by any player. The token remains on the map, but the Discovery card should be placed to the side of the map. As soon as any player takes control of the territory, she can claim the Discovery card.
When you put a Discovery token on your Capital, it can never be captured.
In addition to Discoveries, you can also purchase Generals:
There are three Generals available in every game, and each is represented by a unique miniature.
You may purchase Generals in any age.
The Generals are very powerful and can often change the course of a game. They are different from Discoveries in that each one requires a combination of two different research disciplines.
For example, if a player wishes to purchase the Leviathan, she must pay 5 Sorcery IPs and 2 Religion IPs. The Generals are discussed in greater detail on page 14.

Activation Stage
Once all players have “passed” in the Discovery stage, the Activation stage begins. Players take turns in clockwise order, beginning with the player who controls the first player token (unless a different player chose the Technophilia action during the Spymaster Phase). Each player can use any or all of the Discoveries he owns that are capable of activating during this stage. The text on each Discovery card will indicate when and how it can be used. You can activate a Discovery on the same turn that you acquired it. Activation of a Discovery is always optional, and they may be activated in any order.
Once a player has activated all the Discoveries he wishes to, the next player in turn order may activate his Discoveries. Once all players have had a chance to activate their Discoveries, the Activation stage is over.
例：Discovery Use (or “why order matters”)
Charles and Jules have begun the Activation stage of the Research Phase. Charles has the Portal Discovery, which allows him to move up to 3 of his units currently on the map to any unoccupied territories or territories that he controls. Jules has the Juggernaut “J” deployed in his Capital, which allows him to kill up to 3 enemy Soldiers within 2 tiles. Charles has 3 Soldiers controlling a City that is within range of Jules’ Juggernaut. Can he save them?
Every Discovery provides a unique benefit to the player who owns it. You can think of Discoveries as cards that
“break” the rules. When there is a conflict between the rulebook and the text of a Discovery card, the Discovery card takes precedence.
Discoveries must be linked to specific territories on the map through the use of Discovery tokens:
When you purchase a Discovery card, you also take a matching Discovery token.
That token must be placed on either your Capital or a research territory that you control that matches the discipline of the Discovery (for example, the Alchemy token must be placed on a Manufactory or your Capital).

J
It all depends on turn order. If Jules possesses the firstplayer token, he can use his Juggernaut to kill Charles’
Soldiers. If Charles can go first, he can Portal these Soldiers one tile further away from Jules’ Capital (to the unoccupied Citadel, for example), where they are safe from the Juggernaut.


Generals
Leviathan (5 Sorcery + 2 Religion IPs):The Leviathan is a creature of sorcery and mysticism, a demon of unimaginable power. When you research the Leviathan, keep it in your play area until you decide to use it. You may choose to play it at the end of any Reinforcement stage (once all players have passed). You can deploy the Leviathan to any battle on the map you are engaged in. You automatically win the battle:all your opponents’ units in that battle are killed and you take no losses. The Leviathan even destroys Unique Units and the Steamtank. You gain 1 VP for every enemy unit killed by the Leviathan. Immediately after this battle is resolved, remove the Leviathan from the game.
Guardian (5 Religion + 2 Science IPs):The great general known only as the Guardian is a former Purebreed champion who uses a powerful suit of steam-powered battle armor to induce terror on the battlefield. When you research the Guardian, keep it in your play area until you decide to use it. You may deploy the Guardian to any territory under your control at the beginning of a Recruitment Phase. The Guardian remains in this territory for the rest of the game (unless you use the Spymaster action, Gambit, to move him).
Your opponents may not initiate combat in this territory by deploying units to it. Even the Leviathan cannot be used to attack the Guardian’s territory. However, enemy Discoveries (like Juggernaut and Cataclysm) and Espionage cards can target the Guardian’s territory. As a unit, the Guardian gives you control of a territory and any Discovery tokens located there and counts towards recruitment of workers from a Village/City and garnering VPs from resource territories.
Steamtank (5 Science + 2 Sorcery IPs):The Steamtank is a formidable, sentient tank that wanders the land, wreaking havoc wherever it goes. Once acquired, you should immediately place the Steamtank miniature directly onto either your Capital or any Citadel that you currently control.
The Steamtank may move 1 tile at the beginning of each Deployment Phase. This movement occurs directly on the map and is visible to your opponents. You may move the Steamtank into any territory:one that you control, one that an opponent controls, or one that is uncontrolled. However, the Steamtank cannot move into an opposing territory that contains the Guardian. If you move the Steamtank into an opposing territory, that territory is immediately contested (this can affect your opponent’s deployment decisions). The Steamtank can be paired with your Soldiers and Unique Units in battle. The Steamtank gives +3 to Army Strength. If the Steamtank is destroyed in battle, it must be removed from the game. As a unit, the Steamtank gives you control of a territory and associated Discovery token. It also counts as a unit towards recruitment of workers from a Village/City and garnering VPs from resource territories.

例：Steamtank
Jules (white) has penetrated deep into Charles’ (blue) territory, controlling a City a mere 2 tiles away from Charles’ Capital. What nerve!But Charles has the Steamtank and is preparing an assault on Jules’ City. It is the beginning of the Deployment Phase. Charles moves the Steamtank onto the Village/City territory. This occurs in the open, on the map, where both players can see it. Both players then make their deployment decisions in secret. When they have finished and reveal their deployment, Jules has added an additional 3 Soldiers to his City, bringing him to a grand total of 6. Charles has deployed 4 Soldiers to the City to support his Steamtank.
The Combat Phase begins. There are no reinforcement options for either player, so both “pass.” Charles’ Army Strength is 7 (4 Soldiers + 3 for the Steamtank) vs. Jules’
Army Strength of 6. Charles wins the battle. All of Jules’
Soldiers are removed from the Village. Charles gets to keep 1 unit, and of course he chooses his Steamtank. The final board outcome is shown to the right.

Research Strategy
In general, it is to your advantage to pay for Discoveries using the “free” IPs generated from research territories rather than sacrificing valuable workers from your recruitment pool. However, there are times when you might want to speed up the research process, especially if a particularly valuable Discovery is available and several other players may take it. Don’t forget about the Technophilia action, which gives you first choice!
Plan ahead!Carefully examine the Discoveries available in future ages and try to time your IP accumulation so that you can grab a key Discovery as soon as it becomes available. This is especially important for expensive, Late Age Discoveries that provide huge benefits (like Analytical Engine or Cataclysm).
Determining where to place your Discovery tokens is an important strategic consideration in Clockwork Wars. If you’ve just purchased a highly valuable Discovery and don’t want to take the chance of losing it to another player, place the token in your Capital. It will be safe for the rest of the game. However, you can only place one of your Discoveries in your Capital, so choose carefully.

Scoring Phase
Scoring Phases only occur at the end of each age (end of Turns 2, 4, and 7). Each Scoring Phase is sub-divided into 3 stages: the Victory point stage, the Court dominance stage, and the Pollution stage.

Victory point stage
Starting with the first player and then proceeding clockwise, each player receives VPs for every resource territory that she controls:
Forest:for every unit that you have in a Forest, you score 1 VP, up to a maximum of 3 VPs. For instance, if you have 5 units controlling a Forest, you will earn 3 VPs.
Lake:if you have at least 2 units controlling a Lake, you gain 3 VPs.
Otherwise, you gain nothing.
Some Discoveries will also activate during the Scoring Phase to give you VPs. You should tally up the number of VPs you earned and add this total to your current score, using the Score Track and your respective score marker.

Court dominance stage
The player who controls the Court receives a special bonus during this stage. The bonus is different for Turns 2, 4, and 7. The rules for Espionage (on page 18) describe this process in more detail.


Pollution stage
During this stage, every player must reduce the number of units he has in every resource territory to 1 (the lost units are considered killed – if they are Unique Units or Generals, they are removed from the game). This is meant to represent the penalty of exploiting natural resources and producing toxic pollution, and should encourage players to distribute their units across a greater number of resource territories. For example:if you had 3 Soldiers and a Unique Unit (the Hunter) in a Forest, you would have to discard 3 of these units during the Pollution stage. Most likely, you would want to discard the 3 Soldiers (returning the discs to your reserve) and keep the Hunter in the Forest. 2 End of Turn At the end of every turn (except turn 7), players should:
Move the turn marker 1 space along the Turn Track.
Return the Spymaster Action tiles to the locations on the game-board.
Give the first player token to the next player, in clockwise order. 2 Game End
& Victory

Conditions
After the last Scoring Phase of the game is complete, players can convert any remaining IPs they have into VPs.
For every 3 IPs you have (across all research disciplines), you receive 1 VP. For example:if Jules has 4 Sorcery IPs, 2 Science IPs, and 7 Religion IPs at the end of the game, he would receive 4 bonus VPs.
Players should then compare their final VP count. The player with the highest number of VPs wins the game.
If 2 or more players have an equal number of VPs, then those players should count the number of map territories they currently control (at the end of the final turn). The player who controls the most territories wins the game. If there’s still a tie, then the player (among those tied) who was latest in turn order on the final turn of the game wins. 2 Unique Units At the beginning of the game, each of the players selects a different race to play:the Purebreeds, Troglodytes, Rhinochs, or Mongrels. Each race has a Unique Unit, represented by a wooden, cylindrical token. Some races get multiples of their Unique Units, while others only have a single token (for example, the Trogs get 2 Engineer tokens, but the Mongrels only get 1 Hunter). Unique Units are “free” to place onto the board during any Deployment Phase. In other words, they do not cost workers to put into play. Once killed, Unique Units are permanently removed from the game.
Unique Units do, by themselves, give a player control of a territory. They also can be used to garner workers from a Village/City and VPs from resource territories (for example, 2 Soldiers and the Hunter on a Forest would score 3 VPs during a Scoring Phase).
All Unique Units, except for the Operative, are affected by attrition:if they are the only unit in a territory that is out-of-supply during the Attrition stage, they are killed.
Unique Units are not considered to be Soldiers for the purposes of targeting by Discoveries (for example, Discoveries like Dragonflame, Elemental Storm, and Juggernaut cannot kill Unique Units;however, Cataclysm will kill Unique Units since it does not specifically target Soldiers).
The Operative (Purebreeds):1 unit available
Can be deployed to any territory type on the map or a Court. You may ignore normal deployment rules
– the Operative can be deployed to any territory, including those behind enemy lines!
You may re-deploy the Operative during every

Deployment Phase.
If deployed to a Court, the Operative counts as a Spy and can be removed from the game to pay for an Espionage card.
During the Reinforcement stage, if the Operative is in contested territory with just a single enemy Soldier, you may have the Operative kill the opposing Soldier as one of your reinforcement orders.
The Operative is not affected by attrition and is never out-of-supply.
The Operative adds +1 to Army Strength and can be killed in battle.
The Hunter (Mongrels):1 unit available
Can be deployed to any territory type using normal deployment rules.
The Hunter adds +2 to Army Strength and can be killed in battle.
During the Reinforcement stage, you may move the Hunter up to 2 tiles in any direction to join a battle as one of your reinforcement orders. The Hunter may even leave a contested tile to reinforce another battle.
The Hunter is not allowed to move unless it is reinforcing a battle (the Spymaster action, Gambit, allows you to circumvent this rule).
The Engineer (Trogs):2 units available
Can deploy only 1 in a given turn. Can only be deployed to research territories using normal deployment rules.
More than 1 Engineer cannot be located on the same territory.
Engineers increase the IP generation of a research territory by 1 during the Study stage.
Engineers do not add to Army Strength and can be killed in battle.
The Crasher (Rhinochs):2 units available
Can deploy only 1 in a given turn. Can only be deployed to a Citadel or Village/City currently under the control of another player (so, can only be deployed into a battle). The territory you deploy to must be reached through normal deployment rules.
During the Reinforcement stage, for one of your reinforcement orders you must activate the Crasher to instantly kill up to 3 enemy Soldiers.
Once used, Crashers are immediately killed and removed from the game.
例：Combat involving Unique Units
At the beginning of a Deployment Phase, Ada controls a City with 3 Soldiers. Jules decides he wants that City. He’s playing the Rhinochs and deploys 3 Soldiers and a Crasher into the City. Ada, predicting an attack, has deployed an additional 2 Soldiers to help defend her City.
Jules is first in turn order and conducts his reinforcement orders. He activates and discards the Crasher, killing 3 of Ada’s Soldiers. She now has 2 remaining. Jules completes his Reinforcement stage and passes. Ada (who is playing the Mongrels) activates the Hunter, who is within 2 tiles of the battle, moving it in to support her army. She finishes her Reinforcement stage and passes. The players now compare Army Strengths. Jules has an Army Strength of 3.
Ada has an Army Strength of 4 (2 Soldiers + the Hunter).
Ada wins the battle. All of Jules’ Soldiers are killed. Ada loses 3 of her units, deciding to keep her Hunter around to control the Village.


Espionage

Court Intrigue
During set-up, 1 Court is chosen to include in the game and is placed to the side of the map.
Every player has 1 Spy in the Court at the beginning of the game.
You can deploy additional Spies to the Court during the Deployment Phase.
Once placed on a Court, Spies cannot be moved (note that the Spymaster action, Gambit, does not apply to Spies).
Battles never take place on Courts;all players’ Spies co-exist.
Courts are not considered to be territories on the map and cannot be the target of Discoveries that affect territories (such as Cataclysm, Catapult, etc.).
The player who has the most Spies on a Court controls it. If two or more players are tied for the most Spies on a Court, then no one controls the Court. Controlling a Court provides significant benefits during each Scoring Phase. At the end of the first two Scoring Phases (Turns 2 and 4), the player who controls a Court receives a special bonus, as described on the Court card. At the end of the final Scoring Phase (Turn 7), the player who controls a Court receives a certain number of bonus VPs.

Court Rasputin
The Rasputin family is full of thieves and liars.
Early Age bonus:You may draw 2 Espionage cards for free.
Middle Age bonus:You may force each other player in the game to lose 2 VPs. A player cannot go below 0 VPs.
Late Age bonus:You gain 3 VPs.

Court Pius
The Pius family is righteous and bold.
Early Age bonus:You receive 1 free worker for every Shrine you control (placed into your recruitment pool).
Middle Age bonus:You may take the Guardian general at no IP cost. If another player has already researched (and possibly deployed) the Guardian, you may steal the Guardian away from that player, remove it from the map if necessary, and place it into your play area.
Late Age bonus:You gain 4 VPs.

Court Lovelace
The most powerful family in the realm, steeped in technowizardry.
Early Age bonus:You receive 3 IPs from any research disciplines.
Middle Age bonus:You may claim any one available (non-researched) Discovery at no IP cost.
This includes Late Age Discoveries!
Late Age bonus:You gain 5 VPs.

Espionage Cards
Espionage cards offer another way to punish your enemies. They can be played unexpectedly, disrupting your opponents’ carefully crafted plans. During set-up, you receive one Espionage card;keep it hidden from your opponents. There is only one way of drawing additional Espionage cards into your hand. During the Spymaster Phase, if you take the R & D action, you can draw 2 Espionage cards from the deck and choose 1 of them to keep in your hand. Place the other on the bottom of the Espionage card deck.
All Espionage cards cost 1 of your Spies to play. The Spy must be removed from the Court and returned to your reserve when you play the card. Once resolved, Espionage cards should be placed face-up into a discard pile next to the Espionage deck. If the Espionage deck is ever empty (there are no cards to draw), shuffle the discard pile to create a new deck.

Espionage cards have a text that describes both when it can be played and the effect of the card. For example, the Ambush card above can be played during the Reinforcement stage of the Combat Phase. You would play this card as one of your reinforcement orders. Some Espionage cards are played at the “start” or “end” of a particular phase. These should be resolved before any players take any actions, or once all players have finished taking actions, respectively. If multiple players play Espionage cards that have identical timing (for example, two different players play an Espionage card that activates at the beginning of a Scoring Phase), these cards should be resolved in player order. 2 Negotiating Players involved in 3-4 player games of Clockwork Wars may choose to engage in negotiation and form temporary alliances. Rather than provide specific rules on this aspect of the game, we recommend that you decide how you want to incorporate negotiation (if at all) into your games.
Here are some loose suggestions:
Before starting play, decide whether your group wants to allow open negotiations and alliances and whether there will be any restrictions on such negotiations.
For example, you might allow players to engage in any form of negotiation or deal, including exchanges of resources such as influence tokens, discoveries, and espionage cards. We do not recommend that you ever allow players to exchange/remove/add workers, spies or units of any kind as part of any deal. For example, you could allow a player to say, “I promise not to attack you this turn if you give me 3 Sorcery IP.” However, a player could not ask for the following, “I’ll give you my Mechanical Man discovery, if you remove all your spies from the court.”
Alternatively, you could state that players are not allowed to exchange resources of any kind when making deals.
Deals and promises should not be binding, meaning that players should be allowed to betray and backstab without “formal” (rule-mediated) consequences. 2 Epic Game Variant Do you crave a slightly slower pace in your games of Clockwork Wars, where there’s more time to build up your forces and respond to your enemy?Do you want to try out larger maps, where there’s more room for exploration before players start engaging in battle?Then try the Epic Game variant!
During set up, use the Epic Game side of the game-board.
There are only a few minor rules changes to the Epic Game:
Each Age lasts for 3 turns. Thus, the game is 9 turns long and Scoring Phases occur on turns 3, 6, and 9.
During set-up, players do not receive 1 IP in each discipline.
Capitals provide 3 workers during the Recruitment
Phase (instead of 4). 2 2 vs. 2 Alliances Variant The 2 vs. 2 Alliances Variant is specifically designed for team play. Here is a summary of the rules changes for this variant.
Terminology & Game Objective
There are two alliances competing against each other.
Allies are players on the same alliance. Allies are not considered to be “opponents” or “enemies” for any rule or card effect. The alliance that has the most combined victory points at the end of the game wins.

Set-Up
Set up a 4-player map in whatever way you wish. We recommend that allies do not place their Capitals too close to one another. Allies should sit across from each other, such that player order alternates between members of the opposing alliances.

Commanders & Control
Every turn, one player from each alliance serves as the commander until the end of the turn. The commander is the ally who is earlier in player order.
Allies are allowed to have units on the same map territory.
The ally who possesses the highest Army Strength on a territory controls it. If there is a tie in Army Strength between allies then the alliance commander controls the territory.
Courts can only be controlled by one player. The player with the most spies on a court is in control of it. Allies do not add together the number of spies they have on the court to determine control. If two allies tie for greatest number of spies on a court, the alliance commander controls it.

Spymaster Phase
Here are some clarifications for Spymaster actions in the Alliance variant:
先手：You may move your units into territories that your ally controls.
防諜：Your ally does not lose IP when you take this action.

Recruitment Phase
If a Village/City is occupied by units from both allies, only one player can be in control and recruit workers from that territory.
Deployment Phase & the Callto-

Arms Request
You must follow normal deployment rules in alliance games. Meaning, you are not allowed to deploy your units to territories that your ally controls unless you would normally be allowed to deploy to that territory. You are allowed to conduct a Forced March through a territory that is controlled by your ally.
Each commander is allowed to make one call-to-arms request to their ally during the Deployment Phase, in an effort to coordinate the alliance and consolidate army strength. To do so, they write down the ID tag of the tile they wish their ally to deploy units to on a piece of paper, and pass that (hidden) information to their ally. The ally does not have to fulfill the call-to-arms request if she does not wish to. Otherwise, allies are not allowed to openly discuss their deployment orders and must make them in secret.

Combat Phase
If allies occupy the same territory (but there are no enemy units present), the territory is not contested and no battle occurs.

Reinforcement stage
You are allowed to make reinforcement orders that benefit your ally, even if none of your own units are directly involved in that battle. Allies can engage in “table talk” during the Reinforcement stage to coordinate their efforts
– but Reinforcement orders must still be completed in player order.

Battle stage
Calculate the Alliance Army Strength by adding together the Army Strength of allied units. Compare the Alliance Army Strengths to determine the winner of the battle. All units from the losing alliance are destroyed. The winning alliance gets to keep units in the territory equal to the difference. The commander decides which exact units remain.

例：Alliance combat
Hassan and Aili are allies playing against Inara and Karim.
Hassan and Inara are commanders of their respective alliances this turn. All 4 players have units in a battle.
Hassan has 3 soldiers, Aili has 4 soldiers, Inara has 4 soldiers, and Karim has 1. The alliance Army Strengths are:7 (Hassan & Aili) vs. 5 (Inara & Karim). All of Karim’s and Inara’s soldiers are killed. Since Hassan is commander of the winning alliance, he gets to decide which 2 units to keep in the territory. He chooses one of his soldiers and one of Aili’s soldiers. All remaining allied soldiers are killed.

Attrition stage
Territories controlled by your ally can be used for supply purposes.

Research Phase
If a research territory (e.g., Tower, Manufactory, Shrine) is occupied by units from both allies, only one player can be in control and earn IP from that territory during the Study stage.
You cannot place a discovery token that you have researched into a territory that is controlled by your ally.
If you control a territory with a discovery token, and then your ally takes control of that territory at a later time, he also takes control over the discovery card and associated token.

例：Discovery ownership
Hassan researches the Mechanical Man and places it in a Manufactory that he controls with 1 soldier. His ally, Aili, also deploys a soldier to that same territory on a later turn. If they both maintain an Army Strength of 1 in that territory, control over the discovery will alternate every couple turns, depending on who is commander (i.e., who comes first in turn order). Control of the discovery would change ownership as soon as the first player token was shifted.
Generals & Unique Units
You cannot use the Leviathan to win a battle that does not involve any of your units (but does involve your ally’s units).
You cannot deploy the Guardian to a territory that your ally controls. Your ally is allowed to deploy units to a territory protected by your Guardian. However, if your ally possesses a higher Army Strength in the Guardian’s territory, she does not gain control over the Guardian (it remains under your control).
If you control a research territory that also holds one of your ally’s Engineers, you do receive the research bonus (+1 IP during Study stage) granted by the Engineer.

Scoring Phase
If a resource territory (e.g., Lake, Forest) is occupied by units from both allies, only one player can be in control and earn VPs from that territory during the Victory Point stage. That sole player’s units determine the VP acquiring from that resource territory. For example, if both Hassan and Aili have 1 Soldier on a Lake, neither would gain any VP from the territory during the Scoring Phase.
Only one player can ever be in control of a court and gain its bonus during the Court Dominance stage.

ゲーム終了
At the end of the game, allies should add together their final VP totals. The alliance with the most VPs is the winner!If there is a tie in VPs, the alliance that controls the most territories at the end of the game is the winner. If there is still a tie, then the alliance of the player who came last in turn order on the final turn wins the game.

Map Generation
Every time you play Clockwork Wars you can create and use a different map. There are three different ways of going about this.
First, you can use one of the pre-designed maps for your player count. On the following pages, you will see sample maps for 2, 3, and 4 player games. These maps were designed to be well-balanced and somewhat symmetrical. They might be a good choice if this is your first time playing.
Second, you can randomly generate a unique map for your player count using the guidelines outlined here. Be aware that it is possible you will randomly generate a map that creates a more challenging strategic situation for a particular player. We suggest that you generate the map first and then decide which player will take which capital - preferably, the least experienced player should get first choice.
Third, you can design your own map, using whatever tiles and whatever configuration you wish. Be creative!You can even include “blank spaces” in the map (where no tile is present) to represent impassable terrain, like mountain ranges or fierce deserts. We provide a recommended number of tiles (and specific territory types) for each player count in the following pages, but you might come up with something very different that works great for your play-group. If you do, let us know about it!

2-player maps
We suggest using the general layout provided here:
The tiles marked “C” are the Capitals for each player. The remaining 20 tiles should be randomly drawn from the following choices:6-9 Research Territories (2-3x of Towers, Manufactories, & Shrines) 4-6 Resource Territories (2-3x of Forests & Lakes) 2-4 Villages 2-3 Citadels 0-3 Barrens When building your map randomly, first select the tiles that you wish to include and place them all into a draw bag. Randomly select tiles one at a time and build your map, starting in column 1, moving to the next column, continuing until you finish column 6.

3-player maps
We suggest using the general layout provided here:
The tiles marked “C” are the Capitals for each player. The remaining 27 tiles should be randomly drawn from the following choices:9-12 Research Territories (3-4x of Towers, Manufactories, & Shrines) 4-8 Resource Territories (2-4x of Forests & Lakes) 4-6 Villages 2-4 Citadels 0-2 Barrens

4-player maps
We suggest using the general layout provided here:
The tiles marked “C” are the Capitals for each player. The remaining 34 tiles should be randomly drawn from the following choices:12 Research Territories (4x of Towers, Manufactories, & Shrines) 7-9 Resource Territories (4-5x Forests, 3-4x Lakes) 5-7 Villages 3-4 Citadels 2-4 Barrens
