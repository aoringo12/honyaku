ヴァスト：クリスタルカーヴァン - FAQ 1.1(2017/4/6)
基本
何が「攻撃」かそうではないか？
これらが攻撃だと考えられます：
- ナイトが同じタイルにいる対戦相手プレイヤー（またはクリスタル）とエンカウントする。
- ゴブリンが攻撃アクションを使用する。これはハイディングスポットシークレットカードを使用する時も含まれる。
- ゴブリンのアンブッシュによる攻撃も含まれる。
- ドラゴンがクロウかスクラッチを使用する。
• The Thief using Pickpocket or Backstab (including with
the Hand Crossbow upgrade).
These are NOT considered attacks (non-inclusive list, but if it
isn't in the list above, assume it goes here):
• Any player taking a Treasure or a Gem from the map.
• The Knight using the Bow or the Enchanted Bow.
• The Goblins using Hex or Cave-In (Secrets).
• The Dragon using Hiss, Slap, Flame Wall*, or Wrath.
(*Even if pushed into it by some other effect.)
• Any harm caused by a trapped Dragon Gem.
• The Cave using Soporific Spores or Giant Bats.
More Details/Clarification:
This means that...
The Goblins can use Trap to protect against being attacked
(Encountered) by the Knight, but it does not apply to
Ambushes or when shot. They can discard Trap to ignore a
hit from the Dragon's Claw, Scratch, or Hiss (because Trap
refers to powers, not attacks) but it will not protect them
from Wrath or Flame Wall. It will protect them from being
Pickpocketed or Backstabbed by the Thief.
The Goblins' Rage is increased whenever they are attacked
AND when harmed by certain other (non-attack) abilities –
these are listed on their player board in the Rage section.
The Thief can use Unnatural Evasion when attacked
(Encountered) by the Knight, when targeted with an Attack
action from the Goblins, or when hit by the Dragon's Claw or
Scratch. He cannot use it when targeted by the Knight's
Enchanted Bow or the Cave's Spores, or when entering a
space with a Flame Wall.
The Sidequests section in the rules states that the ones
referring to "attacks" require the Knight to attack
(Encounter) another player during her own turn. Ambushes
and using the Bow specifically do not count, unless the
individual quest specifically says otherwise.
INITIAL SETUP: Do the first 4 Dark tiles around the
Entrance need to show at least one of each Goblin Tribe
symbol?
The four tiles set adjacent to the Entrance tile during setup
do not need to show different Goblin Tribe symbols. Due to
the random draw, only two of the symbols or even just one
may be visible. This is okay. While the lack of one or more
symbols may have a minor effect on the Goblin player’s very
first turn, it will not affect the overall outcome of the game
in any meaningful way.
FORCED MOVEMENT: Do characters take negative effects
from being forced to move into a dangerous tile?
Effects caused by entering tiles, such as a Terrain tile or a
space with a Flame Wall, still apply normally when moved by
another player.
However, Goblins do not lose population by leaving tiles
(such as Lit tiles or Magma).
And, if the Knight enters a space with an Event token, she
must stop.
VAST: THE CRYSTAL CAVERN – COMPILED FAQ 1.1 (April 6, 2017) 2
KNIGHT
Is the Knight required to do anything when she enters a
new tile?
Yes. She is required to:
Explore the tile, Resolve Event tokens, Attack Goblin Tribes
(her Strength needs to be higher), Attack surface Dragons
(her Strength needs to be equal to or higher than Armor)
She may move past the following:
the Thief, underground Dragon, Treasure Tokens, Crystals,
Dragon Gems
If the Knight is out of Encounters, can she keep moving if
she has unspent Movement (or vice versa)?
The Knight may no longer move if she is out of Encounters.
She may still use Equipment, Treasures, and other abilities
that do not require Encounters (Bomb, Bow, Javelin, etc.).
At zero movement she can spend Encounters in the same
space, which in the late game is very important to attack the
Dragon.
GRIT
When the Knight flips a Dark tile to reveal it, is the Grit gain
instantaneous?
The Grit is gained only after resolving the icon on the tile
(Event, Ambush, etc), but before resolving any interaction
with another character or token on the tile.
What happens if a Knight gets more than 45 Grit, and then
is forced to lose Grit? Do you keep tracking Grit over 45?
Grit is capped at 45, so if the Knight loses Grit while maxed
out she subtracts from 45. All other players have hard caps
to their skills, and no way to prevent harm from other
player's actions (the way an unlimited Grit would do).
If 45 Grit is the cap, does the Knight have to turn in a
Sidequest as soon as it is complete, or can she hold on to it
in case she loses Grit?
Revealing a Sidequest is optional ("you may").
If the Sidequest requires something specific to occur, like
attacking another player, you have to reveal it when that
action happens, otherwise you may wait to reveal until the
next time it occurs. This applies to Adventurous, Cunning,
Daring, Eagle-Eyed, Fearless, Stalwart, and Swift.
Bedecked, Intrepid, and Persistent are based on things that
can add up over time, so as long as you're past that
threshold, you can choose to reveal them at any time during
your turn, even if you just drew the card after revealing a
different Sidequest.
CAVE BREAD: Earlier in the game, Cave Bread (Event) gave
the Knight the 35 level Grit cube. If the Knight currently
has 33 Grit, then loses 2 Grit, does she give back the 35
level Grit cube? Or does she only give it back if she went
past 35 and then went back down?
Under normal circumstances you gain the yellow cube as
soon as the red tracking cube hits the white space. So, after
having Cave Bread, only if you move up to the empty 35 then
fall back to a lower number must you return a cube.
* SEE REVISED CAVE BREAD CARD FOR ALTERNATE RULES.
SIDEQUESTS
EAGLE-EYED: Can the Knight shoot with a Strength of 1
(dealing no damage) and satisfy this Sidequest?
No, it has to produce a result of some sort. It's one of the
easier quests to complete, but the Knight still needs to do
more than just put a cube on the Bow space to qualify for it.
PERSISTENT: Do Crystals smashed by Goblins or Dragon
count? Is this the reason why Goblins should hand their
Crystals to the Knight?
All Crystals that are smashed count toward Persistent,
regardless of who does it. If other players don't (or forget to)
hand those Crystals to the Knight, an easy way to check is to
count how many Crystal tiles are in play that don't have
intact Crystal tokens on them.
In variants when the Knight or Goblins need to smash
Crystals for their victory goals, it's generally best for the
other players to avoid smashing them for their opponent.
AMBUSH TILES
If the Knight reveals an Ambush tile, does she gain Grit
before or after resolving the Ambush?
The Ambush should be resolved completely before gaining
the Grit.
Does the Knight only resolve Ambush icons when she
herself reveals the tile? When the Dragon or other player
flips it, is it now considered an empty space?
Yes. Goblins Ambush only when the Knight flips the Dark tile.
If the Dragon or the Thief reveals the tile, the Goblins run
away.
Does a Knight revealing tiles via Flare trigger Ambushes
from Ambush tiles?
Ambushes are only triggered when they are revealed by the
Knight entering a Dark tile with the symbol (or when she
draws an Ambush Event card). They are ignored when
revealed by Flare, Flame or any other effects that reveal
tiles, and when passed through later.
VAST: THE CRYSTAL CAVERN – COMPILED FAQ 1.1 (April 6, 2017) 3
ANCIENT MAP
If the Knight uses the Ancient Map to move through a wall
to a Dark tile, can she orient the newly revealed tile so that
its wall is against the tile from which the Knight moved
(contrary to the Knight’s normal reveal rules)?
Yes, when using the Ancient Map, the path is already closed
off and placing a new wall back-to-back with the previous
one doesn't change that.
Can the Knight use the Ancient Map to move through a wall
that leads into empty space? Does this force the Cave to
play a tile there for the Knight to go on?
No, there must already be a tile in the destination space for
her to enter.
However, the Knight could instead use a Bomb on such a
wall. This would create a new edge forcing the Cave to place
a new Dark tile (if prior to the Collapse).
BOMBS
When a Knight places a Bomb to remove a wall, what
happens if that wall is later rotated by the Cave player?
The Bomb is removed and discarded from the game.
When a Knight places a Bomb to remove a wall on one tile
and the adjoining tile doesn't have a wall, what happens if
the adjoining tile is rotated to now have a wall there?
The Bomb is removed and discarded from the game.
If a Knight uses a Bomb to remove a wall, can the Cave
place a Rockslide in its place?
Yes, since a removed wall acts as an open side. In this case,
the Bomb remains in play, and if the Rockslide is moved later
in the game, then the Bomb’s effect is re-instated.
Can a Bomb be used to remove a Rockslide?
Yes. A Rockslide acts as a wall. The Rockslide token is then
returned to the Cave player.
Is there any way for a Knight to get a Bomb back?
No. The Knight can destroy three walls per game, total.
BOW
If a Goblin is in a Dark tile, can it be targeted by the Bow?
The Bow (or anything else that requires visibility) can be
used to shoot into a Dark tile, it just can't shoot through
them.
TREASURE
If there are two Treasure tokens in a single tile, can the
Knight take both as a single Encounter?
Yes, she can take them all as a single encounter. The
Treasures are resolved individually, one at a time, so you
have to decide whether to keep the first before seeing the
second. (The Cave draws two and chooses one to give, then
draws two more and choose one to give, etc.)
ENCHANTED BOW: Does this weapon inflict damage when
hitting the Dragon or does the effect replace the usual
effect of an attack?
The Enchanted Bow only causes the Dragon to discard cards,
but does not cause it to lose Health. It kills the Thief because
he has nothing else to lose.
Note that the Knight cannot attack the Dragon or the Thief
with the standard Bow.
MIGHTY AXE: Can the Hero cube be discarded to remove
health if the initial attack did no damage?
No, the initial attack must hit in order to use the secondary
effect for additional damage.
MIGHTY AXE: If the Knight has unspent Hero cubes, can
she use the Mighty Axe more than once in a single turn?
If sufficient Hero cubes remain after discarding a cube, the
Knight can place another cube on this Treasure, use another
Encounter to make a second attack, and then discard that
cube to cause additional damage a second time.
JAVELIN / MIGHTY AXE: Can the Javelin be combined with
the Mighty Axe?
It is weird, but yes they can be combined. Think of the
encounters more as several minutes of stalking and then a
pitched battle more than just one moment of combat. All of
the activated Treasures represent an advantage during that
pitched battle.
SILVER GAUNTLET: Does using the Silver Gauntlet’s special
effect replace doing normal damage in the attack?
The secondary effect that causes the target to lose cards or
the Knight to gain Grit applies in addition to the normal
damage caused by the attack, not instead of it.

INTERACTING WITH THE GOBLINS
POISON SECRET: Does it cost the Knight an Encounter to
recover cubes? Does she stop moving to recover the cubes?
Can she use the cubes that same turn? (I ask because my
poison did not slow her down at all.)
No. She just has to move back there.
INTERACTING WITH THE DRAGON
When the Dragon is underground, does the Knight have to
be on the same tile to attack him with a Bomb?
The Knight must be in the same space to attack the Dragon
underground. Think of it as if she's attacking through the
floor.
Please clarify how the Knight attacks the Dragon when
underground/surfaced and before/during the Cave
Collapse.
There are multiple overlapping conditions. This should help
clear it up somewhat:
Dragon underground
:
 Before Collapse = Bomb required, one attack per turn
 During Collapse = Bomb not required, one attack per turn
Dragon surfaced:
 Bomb not required, multiple attacks allowed (each attack
costs 1 encounter)
INTERACTING WITH THE THIEF
When the Knight attacks the Thief and he drops his
Treasures/Dragon Gems, can the Knight automatically pick
all of them up on the same Encounter? Or would she need
to spend an additional Encounter?
Yes, it is intended that the Knight can loot things after
attacks are resolved. After killing the Thief, she can loot the
Thief.
VAST: THE CRYSTAL CAVERN – COMPILED FAQ 1.1 (April 6, 2017) 5
GOBLINS
WAR CARD
If my Goblin stacks are 3/3/4 and I draw a card that shows
1/1/2, I would not have enough pieces of wood to
physically add more population to the last stack. Do I still
overpopulate? Or else what is the intended reasoning for
having only 12 Goblin tokens?
In your example, the first two Tribes would be fine but the
third would hit 4 and then overpopulate, requiring one of the
Tribes to scatter.
The tokens are limited to 12 because a Tribe can never have
more than 4 at a time. Any time you would have to place
more than four it triggers overpopulation and would
immediately reduce that Tribe to four. Effectively, you only
place the first four and then determine if overpopulation
occurs or not.
Can I add some Goblin discs to a Tribe and then spend 1
Rage to stop adding more? For example, suppose Fangs are
currently at 3 Population, War card says to add 2 to Fangs.
Can I add 1 Population to Fangs and then spend 1 Rage to
not add more discs and thus not overpopulate?
No. The rule should read, "You can prevent adding all Goblin
discs to a Tribe by spending 1 Rage per Tribe you affect." It’s
all or nothing.
If the War card has me draw Monsters but all my Tribes
already have Monsters, do I get to keep them in my hand?
Can I play Monsters at anytime or only during the draw
Monster phase?
Monsters all get played immediately. They never go into your
hand. Discard whatever you don't or can't play.
I have 4 Monsters assigned, but then my Bones Tribe
Population drops below 4, and on my next turn I get a War
card that lets me draw Monsters. Can I replace an existing
Monster with one that I drew (since this isn't ASSIGNING
Monsters)?
If the Bones Tribe Strength drops to less than your number of
Monsters, you can keep the ones you have, but you cannot
add OR REPLACE any of them with new ones until the Tribe's
Strength is once again equal to or greater than your number
of Monsters.
MONSTERS
WISP: When is the Knight visible to the Goblin? Visibility
for the Knight and the Bow say that she can't see through
Dark tiles, does this apply the other way around as well?
Visibility works the same for the Wisp as it does for the Bow.
It needs a straight (orthogonal) line, with no walls or Dark
tiles in between. Player pieces do not block line of sight.
WISP: Can the Wisp move the Knight 3 spaces only in a
straight line or can the Knight be moved two spaces in one
direction then 1 space in another?
Direction changes are allowed.
WISP: Can Goblins use the Wisp any time during a move?
i.e. Move some spaces to get into line of sight, slide the
Knight, then move into the Knight's space and attack?
Yes, it can be used in the middle of a move. It's a good way
to reduce the number of Lit tiles between the Tribe and the
Knight.
SECRETS
HIDING SPOTS: What happens if there is a wall between
the Knight and the Ambush tile?
Hiding Spots was intended to be used from an adjacent
visible tile without an intervening wall. But you can play it as
written and allow attacks through walls.
CAVE-IN: When the Goblins collapse tiles, are they subject
to the same rule as the Cave (starting with tiles only
touching another one) or can they pick any tile?
When the Goblins use their Cave-In (Secrets) ability, they can
choose any tiles they want, within the restrictions listed on
the card.
In variants without a Cave player, all tiles Collapsed at the
end of any player's turn follow the standard removal
restrictions/requirements.
TRAP: Trap says +1 Strength +1 Perception and implies the
ability to ignore a Dragon attack. To my understanding
none of the Dragon attacks care at all about Strength or
Perception of Goblin Tribes. What does this card do?
The Strength and Perception bonuses help the Goblins
defend against the Knight and Thief. If the Knight or Thief
successfully strike, the card is discarded.
In addition, if a Dragon attack hits a Goblin Tribe, the card
may be discarded to ignore the attack.
VAST: THE CRYSTAL CAVERN – COMPILED FAQ 1.1 (April 6, 2017) 6
TRAP: Say the Knight's Strength is 4, the Goblin Tribe is 3,
Knight moves onto tile to attack Goblin, Goblin discards
Trap card. Does this mean that the attack fails since the
Goblin's Strength is now equal to the Knight's Strength?
And does the Goblin gain a Rage in this case?
Unlike most of the other Secrets cards that produce an
immediate effect and then are discarded immediately, Trap
gets played to the table in front of you (only on your turn)
and stays there until the trigger for discarding it happens. It
gives a "permanent" Strength/Perception boost for defense
until one of your Tribes is successfully attacked. You can't
play it from your hand in response to an attack.
In your example, by being in play the Trap card makes the
Goblins Strength 4, so the Knight cannot enter their space
and no Rage is gained. The Knight would need to be
Strength 5 to attack, and when she does, the Trap is then
discarded and the Goblins gain 1 Rage.
TRAP: Are you forced to discard a played Trap Secret when
attacked by the Dragon, or can you choose to take the hit
and keep the card?
Discarding it to avoid an attack from the Dragon is optional.
If attacked by the Knight or Thief, it must be discarded after
resolving the attack.
LIT TILES
Does a Goblin Tribe lose Population if it moves through 2
Lit tiles NOT in consecutive movement (moving from dark -
light - dark - light - dark, etc.)?
The Population loss when moving is based on the total
number of Lit tiles a Tribe passes through in one turn,
whether they are consecutive or not.
When Goblins are moved through Lit tiles by other players,
do they lose Population?
No. Forced movement through Lit tile does not cause them
to lose Population.
LURKING
If a Tribe is lurking, and the adjacent tile is removed (via
Collapse or some other effect), does it get "pushed
together" like separated tiles would?
If the lurking Tribe is no longer adjacent to any tile, it returns
to the Goblin player board.
PLUNDER TREASURE
If a Goblin Tribe reveals on a Dark tile with a Treasure, are
they able to plunder the Treasure immediately?
Each Tribe is limited to one action per turn, so if the Tribe's
action for the turn was to reveal, it must wait until its next
turn to plunder the Treasure.
When the Goblins plunder directly from the Dragon, can
they be anywhere on the board or only on the Dragons tile?
Plundering the Dragon requires them to attack, which
requires them to move into the same space as the Dragon.
INTERACTING WITH THE KNIGHT
There are 3 Goblin cards that are directly related to the
Knight (Blob, Wisp, and Poison). Should those cards be
removed in game variants without the Knight in play or are
they considered blank?
They remain in the deck and are treated as "dead" cards that
you can safely discard if you reach your hand limit.
But if your group prefers to remove them feel free to do so.
It's not going to have a drastic effect on the game, and if the
Goblin player is having a hard time it would make things a
little less frustrating for them.
If a Goblin Tribe moves to a tile where the Knight and Thief
are together, and meeting all other requirements to attack,
can they attack both players?
Upon entering the tile, the Goblins are forced to attack the
Knight. This causes the Tribe to scatter before encountering
the Thief.
INTERACTING WITH THE DRAGON
Do the Goblins still gain Rage if the Dragon misses with
Claw, of if they use Trap to avoid being hit?
No, if the attack misses or fails, they don't scatter and don't
gain Rage. However, if 2 Tribes are hit, they do gain 2 Rage.
ASH DRAGON VARIANT: Can the Goblins attack the Dragon
while it is not surfaced? Because the Knight requires bombs
to do so.
Yes, Goblins can attack at any time. That's why the Ash
Dragon card is used – the armor boost offsets the extra cube
that the Knight would have needed for a bomb.
ASH DRAGON VARIANT: Because the Goblins are attacking
the Dragon for victory, can they Ambush the Dragon
(Ambush tiles/Events, Hiding Spaces Secret card)?
The Dragon doesn't interact with Ambushes in any way, so
the tiles and the Hiding Spaces card have no effect. The
Goblins have to take on the Dragon directly.
ASH DRAGON VARIANT: Goblins do not have to attack
when entering a tile with the Dragon. But, do Goblins have
to attack if the Dragon enters their tile, or is it just an
option? Since Tribes lose Rage and scatter immediately on
attacking, I could see a Goblin player wanting to wait until
their turn to attack to keep Rage up and allow them to
draw additional cards.
Once the Dragon has surfaced, the attack is automatic.
ヴァスト：クリスタルカーヴァン - FAQ 1.1(2017/4/6)
基本
If the Dragon is still underground, can other players move
into/through the tile, ignoring the Dragon since he is
technically below the floor?
The Knight can enter and pass through the space freely while
the Dragon is still underground. If he’s on the surface, the
Knight must be stronger or equal to enter the space and
must attack.
Goblins must be stronger to pass through whether he’s
underground or surfaced.
The Thief can pass through freely whenever he wants.
DRAGON CUBES
PRIDE: The Dragon can only remove a Pride cube for “place
a Dragon Gem” or “don’t move” once per game unless he
chooses to use the Slither ability, correct? Can he move a
cube from Pride (Events) to Pride (“don't move”)?
Yes and yes. This was as intended. The two 1-cube Prides are
a little bit easier so making them have a cost (cards) prices
them correctly.
GREED: If there is only 1 Greed cube remaining and the
Dragon picks up more than 1 Treasure token, are the others
saved or immediately returned to the Cave? Can you save
Treasures on board for cubes later moved by Slither?
The Dragon can save as many Treasures as he has cubes
remaining on the Greed track. Any excess Treasures should
be returned to the Cave, unless he uses Slither immediately
to add cubes to the Greed track to allow more.
GREED: If the Dragon saves Treasures, when are they used?
If the Dragon has one saved and picks up a Treasure the
next turn, does he keep the saved Treasure? If that finishes
the Greed track, is the saved cube returned as well?
When the Dragon saves a Treasure, he has to use it on his
next turn. Any additional ones picked up in the meantime get
saved and used on subsequent turns, until the Greed track is
out of cubes.
WAKEFULNESS: When the Dragon surfaces, are all the
cubes from the Wakefulness track discarded?
No, the Cubes stay there. Also, there is nothing preventing
the Dragon from earning more.
MOVEMENT
Does the Dragon ignore walls using the Wing power if he is
underground, or does he use the player board rules strictly
and he only moves 1 over walls regardless of underground
status?
The Dragon ignores walls completely while underground and
can move 1 or 2 spaces per Move/Wing card. Once the
Dragon surfaces he needs Wings to cross walls and he can't
move in the Dark.
Wing lets the Dragon move up to two spaces. Can he move
1 space, use another Power (something that would require
him to be in that position), then finish his Wing movement?
What about regular movement?
The Dragon must complete his entire movement of 1 or 2
spaces before using another power. If he moves 1, then uses
another power, the 2nd space is lost.
The Dragon turns says do these actions in this order:
Move + Powers, Pickup Treasure, Place Gems, Refill Hand.
Does this mean he can only pick up Treasure after he’s
done moving and using powers? Can he use Wing and fly
through a Treasure to pick it up on his way?
Those parts of the Dragon's turn are discrete. The Dragon
will need to stay on the Treasure or Swat them into a pile
and end his turn there. He was simply too powerful
otherwise. Pulling off 2 or more Treasures in one grab is a
huge coup. I think I've only seen 3 Treasures picked up a
handful of times.
REVEALING TILES
SCORCH: Does Scorch reveal the tile the Dragon is standing
on, or only the ones surrounding it?
Surrounding is the 8 spaces around the current tile. Scorch
has no impact on his current tile. In a previous version, it
used to hit all 9 tiles but it was a bit overpowered.
SCORCH: The Dragon is on a tile that is not completely
surrounded and uses Scorch. Does he draw tiles to fill in all
around him and then reveal them?
Only the Dark tiles that were on the map when the Dragon
first used Scorch get revealed. New ones that get placed to
fill open edges are not revealed even if they land in spaces
that would have been affected.
The same applies to Flame, Flare, and Vantage Point.
When revealing a tile with the Dragon, if it cannot be
oriented to make a path back to the entrance, can it be
placed any which way?
If a tile cannot be connected to the entrance, the player that
revealed it may turn it to any orientation they wish.
VAST: THE CRYSTAL CAVERN – COMPILED FAQ 1.1 (April 6, 2017) 8
COLLAPSING TILES (WRATH)
When the Dragon collapses tiles, is he subject to the same
rule as the Cave (starting with tiles only touching another
one) or can he pick any tile?
The Dragon's Wrath removes whatever gets hit by the roll.
In variants without a Cave player, all tiles Collapsed at the
end of any player's turn follow the standard removal
restrictions/requirements.
If the dice roll for Wrath results such that a player has no
legal way off the tile, what happens? Do all tiles except the
"illegal" one collapse? Do you reroll? Or can you not use
Wrath if this is even a possibility?
If there's no way for the player to move without prompting
an attack or going into some other illegal space, the tile
they're on is ignored and remains in place, but any other tiles
hit by Wrath still get removed normally.
Does the order of tile removal matter? i.e. Maybe the
Knight's space is bordered by walls on two sides, and
maybe one open side faces the Dragon (so illegal) and the
other open path is also destined to collapse (but has access
to a non-collapsing area). Thus, if the Knight's current tile
collapses first, she could move to the next, then escape the
collapsing area when it too collapses. But, if the current tile
collapses last, there would be no tile to move to (as the
only legal tile to move to is already gone).
Needing to move through more than one tile is very rare, but
in this example, the Knight would need to move through
valid, adjacent tiles to the nearest one that isn't about to be
removed.
Does the Dragon choose where players move to? Other tile
removal options seem to imply that the moving players get
to choose.
When there is more than one tile available to move into, the
player being forced to move gets to choose.
What happens if the Dragon’s Wrath affects the tile the
Dragon is on, and he has already used up him movement
for that turn? Does he not move, not remove the tile, and
reconnect his disconnected tile to the rest of the map?
Normal Forced Movement rules apply, so the Dragon moves
the fewest number of spaces to reach a legal space. It's free
movement, so it doesn't count against movements already
made or movement still available.
TREASURE
Can the Dragon Swat a Dragon Gem or Treasure token if
there is a wall between them?
Yes. The tile must be adjacent, but it doesn't specify that it
has to be visible.
When Swatting a Gem or Treasure token, can the Dragon
Swat them into and through Dark tiles?
The Dragon may swat Treasures and Gems through Dark
tiles. They cannot pass through walls.
PAST PLUNDER VARIANT: The Dragon has to place a Dark
tile and a Treasure at the end of his turn. Can he place the
Dark tile first, THEN put the Treasure on it?
Yes, the Dark tile should be placed first, then the Treasure
token. The Treasure may be placed on the new Dark tile.
INTERACTING WITH THE KNIGHT
Can the Dragon target and affect the Knight while the
Dragon is still underground?
Yes.
Can the Dragon Slap the Knight if there is a wall between
them?
Yes. The tile must be adjacent, but it doesn't specify that it
has to be visible.
Can the Dragon Slap the Knight through walls or Dark tiles?
Does it have to be a straight line? Our Dragon player
slapped the Knight around corners like a pinball.
The Knight cannot be moved through walls or into Dark tiles.
The Knight can be slapped around corners. We assume with
the Dragon's advanced age, he is a master of bouncing
things off of things.
If the Dragon surfaces on a Crystal tile occupied by the
Knight or Goblin, does he trigger an attack from the Knight
or Goblin (with Ash variant)?
The other player does get a free attack in that situation, if
they're able. The Dragon is essentially making a vertical
move into that "upper" Cave space instead of the usual
horizontal.
Note for the Dragon player: find a better place to surface.
While surfaced, does the Dragon win immediately when he
enters the Entrance tile if the Knight is already on that tile?
If the Knight has enough Strength to hit the Dragon, she gets
a single attack when he enters her space. If her Strength is
less than the Dragon's Armor, she can't attack.
It's just a single attack, not an Encounter or a full turn. So if
that single attack doesn't kill the Dragon, he immediately
escapes after the attack is resolved, and wins the game.

INTERACTING WITH THE GOBLINS
How does the Dragon eat Goblins when there is no Goblin
player?
The Dragon can't eat Goblins in this situation.
In the Knight vs Dragon game, the Dragon starts with 2
Hunger Cubes moved down to the Wakefulness track
already, and doesn’t need the other 2 cubes to awaken.
Also, the Dragon may still use his Slither power to move
those other 2 Hunger cubes to another sloth track.
INTERACTING WITH THE CAVE
SOPORIFIC SPORES: If Soporific Spores cause the Dragon to
lose a level of Spirit, does the Dragon have to discard cards
to meet the new hand size?
No, Spirit only determines the number of cards drawn at the
end of the Dragon’s turn. It's not a hand limit.
In addition, the Dragon cannot fall asleep again.
INTERACTING WITH THE THIEF
When the Dragon uses a power that says, "the Thief is
killed," is the Thief killed automatically if he is in an
affected tile regardless of his Stealth score?
Correct. The Dragon's attacks ignore Stealth completely. You
can't hide from the Dragon.
If the Thief spawns when there's a Flame wall at the
entrance, does it kill him?
No, Flame wall only does damage when a player MOVES
INTO it. If the Thief start his turn in the space with a Flame
wall, even as a respawn, it doesn't hurt him.
VAST: THE CRYSTAL CAVERN – COMPILED FAQ 1.1 (April 6, 2017) 10
CAVE
OMENS
Can the Cave continue to use Omens after "Placing
Treasure" (e.g. to move it into a location you couldn't
normally put it or Collapse the tile)? Or does placing the
Treasure effectively end the turn?
Yes, you can keep going.
TREASURE TOKENS
Are the Treasure tokens finite? When the Knight finds
Treasure do they hold on to the token? When the Dragon
finds Treasure it mentions returning these to the Cave
supply, but not for the Knight.
Yes, Treasures tokens are meant to be limited.
In games without the Thief you use 10, and games with the
Thief you use all 12. This prevents the Cave player from
completely running away with the game if the others ignore
Treasures for too long. Extras are used with the Thief
because he permanently takes them out of play to mark his
upgrades.
When any other player collects a Treasure the token is
returned to the Cave immediately. The Knight gets a
Treasure card instead, the Goblins gain a Rage, and the
Dragon moves a Greed cube to Wakefulness.
Can Past Plunder place multiple Treasures on the same tile?
Or on a tile with another player or token?
No. As per the normal Place Treasure rules, a Treasure must
be placed on a Dark tile that does not contain a player piece
or Treasure token.
GIANT BATS
Can the Cave target a player multiple times with Giant
Bats? Or is it like the Thief who cannot target the same
character multiple times with one ability?
Yes, Giant Bats can be used multiple times on the same
target as long as the Cave can pay the cost in Omens.
Keep in mind that the Knight cannot be moved into Dark tiles
or tiles with other players, so it may not be possible to push
her more than a few tiles in a single turn.
Can the Cave move the target through a space with another
player as long as the movement does not end on the other
player?
No, each individual space during the movement must be
legal.
ROCKSLIDE
Can a Rockslide be placed between 2 Dark tiles or between
a Lit tile and a Dark tile?
At least one of the tiles must be Lit, to establish whether a
wall is there or not.
The Rockslide token remains in place when an adjacent Dark
tile is revealed, even though the way that tile gets oriented
may make the token redundant. If it ends up on a "real" wall,
the Cave player can always move it later using the Rockslide
ability again.
The token is specifically placed on the edge between the two
tiles, so it creates a wall on both tiles instead of being
specific to one or the other. That's why the token is removed
if either tile is rotated or removed.
What happens if a Rockslide is placed on a Bomb token?
Both tokens remain on the tile. If the Rockslide is moved later
in the game, the wall once again becomes open.
SOPORIFIC SPORES
GOBLINS: Who chooses which Goblin Tribe gets reduced?
And does it have to be on the board?
The Goblin player chooses the Tribe. It does have to be a
Tribe that can be reduced, if possible – you can't dump it on
a Tribe at 0 or 1 to negate the effect entirely.
DRAGON: When the Dragon gains a sloth token, who
decides where that sloth token goes?
The Dragon chooses where the sloth token goes.
DRAGON: If the Spores cause the Dragon to lose a level of
Spirit, does the Dragon have to discard cards to meet the
new hand size?
No, Spirit only determines the number of cards drawn. It's
not a hand limit. That is one of the reasons why the Dragon
draws at the end of his turn.
In addition the Dragon cannot fall asleep again.
THIEF: Where does the Thief put his removed Upgrade
token? Does it go to the “unstashed” tokens space?
There isn't a space on his board designated specifically for
the Spored tokens, so he can place them anywhere on or
nearby the board. Just make sure they don't get mistaken for
other Upgrades or Treasures currently being carried.

PLACING TILES
In the video rules regarding the way the Cave adds tiles into
play, you insist on the fact that it's very important to place
tiles one by one, drawing another one before placing the
second tile. I had believed this was to limit the way the
Cave can place the Crystal tiles, but the rules state: "Tiles
placed during other players' turns do not have to be Crystal
tiles." So is this rule limited only to the Shaping The Cave
and Hatred omen?
Placing the tiles one at a time allows the Cave player to
retain some control over what is getting placed. Otherwise,
any time three or more edges got opened up at once the
Cave would be forced to empty its entire hand, possibly
placing tiles it wanted to save for later.
The Cave's requirement to place Crystal tiles first during its
turn applies no matter what causes that placement –
Shaping the Cave, Hatred, or even from rotating tiles.
Is it the same with the Vault tiles (I'm pretty sure I've seen
it in the video but can't find it in the rules)?
Vaults are not restricted in any way, and can be placed as
desired like any other non-Crystal tiles.
VAST: THE CRYSTAL CAVERN – COMPILED FAQ 1.1 (April 6, 2017) 12
THIEF
Setup says, “Before your first turn, place the Thief piece on
the Entrance tile.” Does this mean at the start of the game,
or before his own first turn?
The Thief gets placed on the entrance tile before his own
turn, not at the very beginning of the game.
MOVEMENT
When does the Thief's turn end? If he has 2 cubes left to
use but runs out of movement are those cubes lost?
Likewise, if he had used up his cubes, can he still move?
The Thief's turn ends when he runs out of things to do or
when he chooses to end. If he has movement remaining he
can continue moving even if all of his action cubes have been
spent. If he runs out of movement he can still use whatever
action cubes he has left.
If there are any action cubes left over that the Thief can't (or
doesn't want to) use at the end of the turn, they're lost and
are not saved for future turns.
After spending all his movement, can the Thief use any
remaining action cubes to decrease his Loot Drop level?
Hide Loot is a good use for any actions left over at the end of
a turn, and so is the Flare if it's available (depending on the
variant).
If there is a tile, then a blank space, then another tile in a
straight line, can the Thief climb through the blank space
using the impassible terrain mode of his Climbing ability?
Or is this only for the Terrain tiles variant?
No. That sounds neat though, try it and get back to us?
Can the Thief use Climb to move through a wall to an
adjacent Dark tile? If yes, how is this tile placed when
revealed?
The Thief can Climb a wall to a Dark tile. It would remain
Dark for the Thief unless he used his free peek/reveal at the
end of movement.
Any time a tile is revealed, if it can't be oriented so that it
connects through Lit tiles back to the entrance, you can turn
it to any direction you wish.
REVEAL TILES
The rules state that the Thief can reveal a tile “orienting it
as you choose.” Is that intended to be taken literally, or
does it mean orient it as he desires so long as an open side
connects to an adjacent tile?
If there is a path available to the Entrance, the Thief must
orient it that way. If no path is available, he may orient it in
any direction.
STASH TREASURE
If the Thief carries 2 Treasures and a Dragon Gem to the
Entrance, does he get three upgrades in a single stash?
Yes, if the Thief stashes multiple Treasures at once he can
claim an upgrade for each.
Remember that the more stuff he's hauling around the
easier he is to attack because each Treasure or Gem carried
reduces his Stealth by 1.
If the Flame Wall is dropped on the Entrance and the Thief
enters the tile, does he die before stashing his Treasure? If
he dies, where does he drop the Treasure – on the Entrance
or the adjacent tile he came from?
He would die when he entered the Entrance tile, so any
Treasures he was carrying would drop on that tile.
If the Treasure is dropped on the Entrance, does the Thief
have to leave and re-enter the Entrance after picking up the
Treasure to stash it?
Assuming no one else took them or pushed them away from
the Entrance before his next turn, the Thief would stash them
immediately upon picking them back up.
If the Thief is moved onto the Entrance by another player,
does he immediately stash any carried Treasure, or would
he have to wait until the start of his turn?
The Thief stashes it immediately.
There aren't any abilities that would allow other players to
do this directly, but this could potentially happen if he had
the evasion upgrade and someone attacked him while he
was in the space next to the Entrance.
LOOT LEVEL
When the Thief spends action cubes to drop his Loot Level,
is that permanent (until stashing) or only for the turn?
It is permanent until the next Treasure is stashed.
Does the Thief's Loot Drop level change at all upon death?
No, it only changes when he stashes Treasure (resets to 3), or
if he spends action cubes to reduce it.

INTERACTING WITH THE KNIGHT
PICKPOCKET: Does the Knight or the Thief choose the
Treasure? And does the Thief get to look at the Knight’s
Facedown Treasure cards when choosing?
The Thief can choose a revealed Treasure, or take a random
Facedoown Treasure.
What does the Thief do with the Treasure card he
pickpockets?
The card goes to the bottom of the Treasure deck.
INTERACTING WITH THE GOBLINS
PICKPOCKET: Does the Goblin or the Thief choose the
Secrets card? And does the Thief get to look at the Goblin’s
Secrets cards when choosing?
The Thief chooses a random unrevealed secret from the
Goblin’s hand, or he may take the Goblin Ruby if it’s face-up.
What does the Thief do with the Secrets card he
pickpockets?
The card is discarded.
INTERACTING WITH THE DRAGON
If the Thief spawns when there's a Flame wall at the
entrance, does it kill him?
No, Flame wall only does damage when a player MOVES into
it. If the Thief start his turn in the space with a Flame wall,
even as a respawn, it doesn't hurt him.
BACKSTAB: Does the Dragon get to look at and choose
which Power cards to discard, or are they discarded
randomly?
The Dragon chooses which cards to discard.
VAST: THE CRYSTAL CAVERN – COMPILED FAQ 1.1 (April 6, 2017) 14
TERRAIN
CANYON
Can the Dragon cross the Canyon’s outside spaces while
underground?
No. The Dragon may only cross the Canyon’s outside space if
surfaced and using Wing.
Does a wall on either side (or both sides) of the Canyon
affect the use of Wing to fly over the Canyon?
Yes. Using Wing to cross a wall moves the Dragon from one
side of the wall to the other, so both sides have to be a legal
space for the Dragon to stop, even just for a moment.
Would it be possible to use 2 Wings to fly over the space,
then turn 90-degrees and exit a different side (as opposed
to flying straight over), or would finishing a Wing move
over the space be considered "ending movement"? This
might also apply if the Dragon was approaching from 2 tiles
away.
The intention is that the Dragon would have to cross (fly)
completely from one side to the other using a single 2-space
movement, so he can't change direction mid-move.
Can the Thief turn 90-degrees on an outside space and exit
a different side?
The Thief (using Climb) isn't limited to straight-line moves, so
he could make a 90° turn on the way through.
MAGMA
If a Goblin/Thief is pushed into Magma (and left there)
using Giant Bats, is it scattered/killed? Does the Goblin
lose Population if pushed through Magma?
No. Magma is specific about players ending their turns
there, so being pushed into there will not hurt anyone unless
they decide to stay there.
If they are allowed to end movement there without dying,
does this mean that a Goblin/Thief may legally move off a
Collapsing tile onto Magma and stay there until their next
turn?
Yes.
MUSHROOM FOREST
If a Goblin Tribe is in the Forest when Wrath hits it, how
would the Forest "protect" them? Would they be displaced
to the nearest tile, would they be scattered (i.e. not
protected at all), or would the tile simply not Collapse?
Wrath targets the tile, not the players. It isn't an attack and
doesn't target the Goblins directly, so the Forest won't
protect them from scattering when it gets destroyed.
Cave-In can remove the Forest too, but any Goblins on it
would be allowed to move to a nearby safe tile just like if the
tile had Collapsed normally.
PITS
How much movement does it take to use the Pits?
The Pits each require a movement, so at minimum 3
movement is needed – one into pit A, then one into pit B, and
then one out of B.
How does the Dragon use the Pits?
The Dragon can use a Pit, but will need two separate
movements to get through. That can be the free move for
the turn plus a Wing, or two Wings. He can end an individual
movement on a Pit, he just can't end his turn on one.
If the Dragon can’t make that second move to leave the Pit
tile before the end of his entire movement, he is not allowed
to enter the first Pit.
Can the Dragon move in any direction before/after entering
the Pit? e.g. use 1 move (out of 2) to travel between Pits,
then move 1 tile in any direction… or, move from any
adjacent tile onto a Pit, then move to another Pit to finish
the move?
Entering a Pit uses the first space of the Dragon's move, then
moving to another Pit tile uses the second movement, so the
[Wing] movement to leave the second Pit is an entirely new
movement and direction doesn't matter.
Can a player be pushed through Pits?
Pits are considered adjacent, so pushing someone through
there would be legal provided they don't stop on either Pit
tile.
RIVER / LAKE
Does the Goblin lose Population if pushed into/upstream in
the River?
Pushing Goblins into any water reduces Population by 1.
Once they're in the water, follow the rule for pushing them
through Lit tiles which prevents them from losing any
additional Population.
VAST: THE CRYSTAL CAVERN – COMPILED FAQ 1.1 (April 6, 2017) 15
COLLAPSING TERRAIN
If Terrain is Collapsed with Goblin/Thief on it, can they exit
the tile at an adjacent edge even if there isn't a tile there
yet (and add one), or do they move to the nearest preexisting
tile? Likewise, can Goblins/Thief be pushed off
Terrain into an empty space (placing a new tile there)?
Exiting terrain to an empty space requires active movement
by the player, so if they're pushed or forced to leave because
of the tile collapsing, it has to be to an existing legal space,
or that terrain can't be removed. It follows the standard
rules for removing tiles, it's just a larger tile.
EXITING TERRAIN
Can Goblins add Dark tiles to multiple edges of Terrain (like
Mushroom Forest) in one turn by moving off into an open
space and adding a tile, then back onto the Terrain, then off
into the next open space and adding a tile...etc?
The intention is once per movement. A Goblin Tribe could
move off one edge, place a tile there, then use Explore to
add a second tile.
The Knight could technically do this legally, but it's costing
her movement and encounters for each tile she adds.
