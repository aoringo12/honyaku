Welcome to my kingdom, naughty little Pixies!
I love gold and silver, and simply adore sweet honey, juicy Apples and freshbread.
My Pixies, I want you to go and get them for me!
Now go forth to steal all of these goodies from the nearby human village of Truro.
Beware, if you fail you will be tossed into the mines to collect gold and silver for me.
Will you be able to bring the best Offerings to your Queen?Only then will your punishment be … less severe!

Hahahahahaha….

Pixies are naughty little mythical creatures, which are mainly found in the region around Cornwall and Devon. They cheat and steal from people all the time. They do this not just for their own amusement, but mainly out of fear of their own Queen who rules her people like a true tyrant, demanding that constant Offerings be made to her.
Two to five players will take on the role of Pixie Leaders trying to outdo each other in satisfying their Queen. Each round, they will collect Silver, Gold and Food as an offering to the Queen.
You will be rewarded for giving her Golden Rings, surprising her with a Special Offering or by becoming one of her Loyal Palace Servants.
However the Queen is not easily satisfied. She will give Penalty Points to those that work the least throughout each round.
To do well you must try to get as few Penalty Points as possible. At the end of the game, this punishment can be eased by the Reward Points you collected along the way. If you manage to end the game with a positive result, you did very well!

Reward Tiles
報酬ポイントを集めながら、クイーンからのペナルティポイントをできるだけ少なく受け取りようにしましょう。ペナルティポイントはマイナスで、マーカーを時計回りに動かすことで、直ちにスコアトラックに記録されます。
報酬ぽんとはプラスですが、ゲーム終了時にのみ、スコアトラックに追加されます。The winner is the player with the highest overall score, but be aware that getting on the positive part of the score track is difficult!あなたがそうするようにマネジメントできているなら、あなた自身が本当に素晴らしい妖精であることを実証することでしょう（とはいってもやはり背は小さいのですが）。
各ゲームのラウンドは5フェイズで構成されます：

I. Stealing phase

II. Action phase

III. Offering phase

IV. Reward phase

V. Penalty phase
Adjust the player turn order by matching the order of the big cubes to the order of the small cubes.
Attention:if someone moved their large cube to the front during the former round, that player received a one-time advantage during the Reward phase and Penalty phase. However, the large cubes will now be arranged to match the order of the small cubes.
The Pixies roam the village of Truro stealing Apples, Bread and Honey. Each Pixie receives Food (obligatory!) according to the food icons depicted on the board at the Pixie’s position.

I. Stealing phase
In addition to avoiding penalties, there are three types of Reward Points to achieve:
Reward Points for Special Offering:

Using the Special
Offering Action you can achieve Reward

Points very quickly.
It only takes you one action, but it’s also the most expensive way to get Reward Points.
Reward Points for Loyal Servants:

During the Reward
Phase, your Pixies can be promoted into the castle of the Queen. In order to compete, you will have to offer the Food type that the Queen desires this round.
Reward Points for Golden Rings:
This strategy requires you to obtain Gold and Silver, and to maintain a good position on the Silver and Gold tracks.
Using the Golden Ring Action, you can forge a Golden Ring with the Gold you obtained.
The Reward Tiles for Special Offering, Loyal Servants and Golden Rings are distributed from left to right.
Reward Tiles for Golden Rings and Loyal Servants decrease in value whereas Reward Tiles for Special Offering increase in value.
If all Reward Tiles with a golden number have been distributed
(3 tracks, 5 Tiles per track), the end of the game is triggered. The current round is finished by the players, after which the final points are calculated.Reward Tiles are kept secret behind the player screens.

Game round
Goal of the game
Pixies in mines are slaves and do not receive any resources.
Food Tiles also generate Food. Players may choose which type of food they receive, in an amount as depicted on the Tile.
During the first round of the game, players cannot steal Food as everyone starts in the mines. If a player has the Permanent Ability of stealing 1 Silver bar however, this player does receive 1 Silver bar from the general supply.
In the unlikely event the Food supply is almost depleted, it’s important to perform the stealing phase using the new turn order.
The Queen’s Favorite takes resources first, followed by the second in line, etc.

D 5 d
Resources are always kept behind the player screens, hidden from the other players. Action Discs, however, must be kept in front of your screen so everyone can see which player(s) can still perform an action.
During the action phase, players take turns choosing an action.
The Queen’s Favorite chooses first, followed by the second player on the turn order track (large cubes) and so on.
Each turn, a player uses 1 or 2 Action Discs to immediately perform 1 action:
1. Either 1 disc on a circular action space with room to place only 1 Action Disc.
Exception:for the action Temporary Priority a player uses all their remaining Action Discs.

II. Action phase
Perform the following steps in order:
1. Everybody makes an offer.
The Queen has a peculiar diet. Each turn She will want 1 specific type of Food:Apples, Honey or Bread.
Turn the leftmost face-down Round Tile face up. One of the Food resources will be depicted on it, determining which type of Food the Queen wants this round.
All players gather resources from their personal supply in a chosen amount, to hold in their hand. They hold out a closed fist and simultaneously open their hands to show which resources they decided to offer to their Queen.
The following rules apply:
- You must always offer 1 type of resource:either the desired Food, or Silver, or Gold. It’s not allowed to offer multiple types of resources, unless a player both owns and uses their Double Offering Tile, allowing that player to hold out 2 hands instead of just 1.

III. Offering phase
2. Or 2 discs on a double action space that does not contain a Pixie.
3. Or 1 disc on a double action space with a Pixie on the space depicting a hand. The Pixie helps you to perform the action regardless of its colour.
If a Pixie and Action Disc are next to each other, it sometimes occurs during the action phase that the Pixie leaves this spot. This doesn’t mean that this action becomes available again.
All double action spaces with at least 1 Action Disc on it are considered to be occupied actions which can’t be chosen anymore.
Some of the circular action spaces are marked with pearls in a single colour and have a Pixie depicted on them. Only the player playing with that specific colour is allowed to use that action space.
The chosen action has to be performed immediately.
Important:you may not choose an action if you’re unable to perform it (exception:the Temporary Priority action).
In the unlikely case that there is no possible action, or you no longer wish to perform any actions, you are allowed to pass (skip taking an action). However the Queen will punish you severely for your lack of trying; you receive 5 Penalty Points and you’re not permitted any more actions during this action phase!
Important:all actions can only be performed once per turn, with the exception of the Silver into Gold action.
The Action phase ends when all the Action Discs of all players are on the board.
Players take back all of their Action Discs before continuing with the Offering phase.
- If someone shows an empty hand (thus offering nothing to the Queen) they immediately receive 5 Penalty Points.
- Offering Food the Queen does not want this turn is not allowed!If a player does offer a different kind of Food by mistake, that player immediately receives 5 Penalty Points and puts the offered Food back into their personal supply.
- All offers, except for the wrong kind of Food, are eagerly accepted by the Queen and are returned to the general supply.
- Silver and Gold are always regarded as being useful offerings, even when a player is no longer able to move forward on the appropriate track.
2. Check to see if at least 1 player offered the right type of Food.
If at least 1 player offered the right kind of Food, the Queen is satisfied and a reward phase is initiated (IV).
If nobody offered the right type of Food, the Queen is outraged by the lack of respect her subordinates have shown her. Perform the following:
- Silver and Gold that were offered are returned to the general supply.
- The player in last position on the Turn Order track (large cubes) must demote one of their Pixies to the mine.
Only promoted Pixies that are currently on a double action space somewhere on the game board, can be demoted.
If the last player doesn’t have a promoted Pixie, or begs for mercy using the Mercy Single Use Tile, the second-to-last player on the Player Turn Order track (large cubes) must send a Pixie to the mines.
Repeat this process until a Pixie is sent to the mines or it reaches the Queen’s Favorite, who doesn’t have to send a Pixie to the mines.
- Skip the entire Reward phase (IV) and move straight to the Penalty phase (V).
All actions are explained starting on page 8 of this rulebook.
1
2
3

D 6 d
This phase only takes place if at least 1 player offered the right kind of Food during the offering phase (III).
Perform the following steps in order:
1. Silver and Gold track
All players that offered Silver advance their disc 1 step on the Silver track. The player that offered the most Silver advances their disc 1 additional step.
In case of a tie, the additional step is not distributed. All players that offered Silver advance just 1 step.
If only 1 player offered Silver, they also offered the most Silver and thus advance 2 steps on the Silver track.
Move the disc(s) on the Gold track in exactly the same manner for players that offered Gold.
2. Promote
All players that offered the correct type of Food to their Queen are allowed to promote Pixies on the game board. They can perform a number of promotion steps equal to the number of correct Food tokens offered.
The promotion is performed according to the current player turn order (large cubes). A player performs all of their promotion steps before it’s the next player’s turn.
Promotion is always performed towards a free action space of the next level on the game board, by putting the Pixie on the action space depicting a hand.
Hint:You can recognise the levels by the number of food icons depicted.
Level 1 has action spaces with 1 food icon, Level 2 has action spaces with 2 food icons, etc.

IV. Reward phase
Important:contrary to the action phase, during the reward phase action spaces can only be occupied by Pixies, as the Action Discs were removed at the start of the Offering phase (III).
If multiple free locations are available on the next level, a player can choose which location they want to move their Pixie to.
When there are no free spaces available to promote any of your Pixies to and you don’t have an Apple to demote an opponent’s Pixie, you lose the remaining promotion steps and the offered food isn’t refunded.
A mine slave can be promoted to the first row of action fields.
Make sure the slave is not chained to any Rocks (see “Mine”

Action).
You can never promote a Pixie to an action field on the same or on a lower level in the game board.
Only one Pixie per round can reach the Loyal Servant space at the entrance of the Queen’s castle. That Pixie remains there until all players have performed all promotion steps.
After all promotion steps have been performed, the Pixie that reached the Loyal Servant spot is moved to the Loyal Servant Reward Tile fields. The player in question takes the leftmost available Reward Tile from the fields and places the Pixie on that space. This Pixie is no longer available to that player for the rest of the game, as it is now working directly for the Queen in her palace …
If you want to promote your Pixie to a space that is already occupied by another Pixie, you need to pay an Apple to the general supply in order to first demote that Pixie. You might want to do this if there is no free action space to promote to, or because the action space seems interesting to you, or just to annoy an opponent by swapping places with one of their Pixies …
If this happens during the Reward phase (IV), do as follows:
1. Use 1 offered Food to perform the promotion step.
2. Pay 1 additional Apple from your personal supply to demote the opponent’s Pixie.
3. Swap both Pixies on the game board.
If this is done during the action phase (II) by performing the Promotion action, do as follows:
1. Promote your Pixie for free. Choose a location with a promoted Pixie of an opposing player’s colour. Locations containing 2
Action Discs cannot be chosen.
2. Pay 1 Apple from your personal supply to demote the opponent’s Pixie.
3. Swap both Pixies on the game board.

Important:
• An Apple can only be used to demote an opponent’s Pixie when performing a promotion with 1 of your own Pixies to the spot of the demoted Pixie. It’s forbidden to pay Apples to demote an opponent’s Pixies at any other time during the game.
• If you demote a Pixie that was on the first level, don’t swap places but put this Pixie back in his own mine.
• A Pixie that has attained the status of Loyal Servant can never be demoted.

D 7 d
At the end of each round the Pixie Queen punishes those who have not worked hard enough to please her. Thus She will punish all players!
Give penalty points in this order:
1. Give each player up to a maximum of 2 Penalty Points for any slaves still in that player’s mine:
B 1 Penalty Point for 1 slave B 2 Penalty Points for 2 or more slaves Important:the two lowest slave positions in the mine are always the first ones to be filled. A player can never evade Penalty Points or getting chained to Rocks by putting slaves on the upper row of their mine.
2. Then the Queen will check whether you offered enough Silver and Gold to Her.
Give each player Penalty Points as depicted on the Silver and Gold track.
Check which step the player’s discs are at and look at the middle row (between both tracks) to see how many Penalty Points these levels correspond to. Both tracks score Penalty Points.
On the second highest level a player is no longer given Penalty Points for that track.
At the highest level of a track a player even receives a Reward Point. Do not advance on the score track.
Instead, take a Reward
Point Tile of value 1 from the general supply and put it behind your player screen, to score at the end of the game.
The game ends when one of the following conditions is met:
- All Reward Tiles with golden numbers are taken (3 times 5

Tiles), OR
- Seven rounds have been played as indicated by the Round Tiles.
In both situations, the current round is finished by the players including the reward and penalty phases.
Final scoring is performed in the following order:
1. All acquired Penalty Points are preserved. You start counting reward points from this point on the score track.
2. Acquired Reward Points are used to move a player’s score marker towards or even beyond the 0 on the score track.
3. For each Rock that remains in a player’s mine, that player receives 1 Penalty Point. Keep in mind that even at this point Bread can be spent to remove Rocks (see “Mine” Action).
4. Finally, the Queen looks behind your player screen and sees all the resources you didn’t offer to her. How dare you?!
For each type of resource cube, determine which player has the most cubes of that particular resource remaining in their personal supply.
Players receive 3 Penalty Points for each resource type that they have the majority of. In case of a tie, all tied players receive 3 Penalty Points.
This is determined for Apples, Honey, Bread, Silver and Gold.
If no player passed the 0 space and all players are in the negative points, the player who has the least Penalty Points wins the game.
If 1 or more players passed onto the positive side of the score track, the player with the most Victory Points wins.
In case of a tie the player with the most Loyal Servants wins the game. If there is still a tie, look to see which of the tied players had a Loyal Servant first. That player is declared the winner.

V. Penalty Phase

Pit of Oblivion
Should a player collect 60 Penalty Points throughout the game, they disappoint the Queen so badly that She has that player thrown into the Pit of Oblivion. The game ends immediately for this player. You worthless Pixie!

Game end

Demoting a Pixie
Regardless of the phase in which it happens, whenever your score marker reaches or passes a slave symbol on the score track you immediately have to demote a promoted Pixie, which then becomes a slave in your mine again.
The following rules apply:
- If you have more than one promoted Pixie on the game board, you can choose which one you demote.
- A Loyal Servant is set for life. It can never be sent back to the mines.
There are a couple of ways in which you can prevent having to demote a Pixie:
- If all of your Pixies are either Loyal Servants or slaves.
- If you own and use the Mercy Single Use Tile to beg for mercy.
- As long as you are the Queen’s Favorite, you don’t have to demote a promoted Pixie.

Actions
1. Steal Food
Take 2 Apples, 2 Honey or 2 Bread from the general supply. `
2. Steal Silver
Take 2 Silver from the general supply.
All supplies are limited. Food, Silver or Gold which is no longer available from the general supply is not distributed.
3. Promotion
Move 1 of your Pixies up 1 row.
This action cannot be used to perform the final promotion to Loyal Servant.
Important:a Pixie can only move to an empty spot on the next row.
Only the spot depicting a hand has to be empty though. It’s allowed to move a Pixie to such an empty spot even if there is 1 Action Disc on the spot next to it.
During the action phase, it’s possible that all action spots are taken by multiple Pixies and/or Action Discs. It isn’t allowed to move Action Discs in order to make room for a moving Pixie.
However it is allowed to pay an Apple in order to swap your Pixie with one of another player on the next row.
If there are no empty spots available to move one of your Pixies to and you don’t have an Apple to demote an opponent’s Pixie, you can’t choose this action.
Aside from the above, all normal rules regarding a regular promotion in the Reward phase apply.
4. Trade
Trade up to 7 resources of
1 type for an equal amount of resources of 1 different type. You can trade Apples, Honey, Bread or Silver.
Gold cannot be traded.
Whenever you acquire a Food Tile, Permanent Ability Tile or Single Use Tile, you put it on your player screen immediately. Each player screen has room for only three different Tiles:1 Food Tile, 1 Permanent Ability Tile and 1

Single Use Tile.
This means that a player can never have more than 1 Tile of the same type (exception:the Permanent Ability Tile which grants extra room for a Food Tile or Single Use Tile).
A player is not allowed to choose an action granting them a Tile if they don’t have room available to store it.
Discarding Tiles (regardless of the type) is forbidden.
Tiles can be exchanged by choosing the Exchange Tiles action (see page
10).
Once used, a player puts a Single Use Tile back on the appropriate space on the game board, where it immediately becomes available to all players again.

Tiles
5. Turning Silver into Gold
The following action can be used to turn Silver into Gold. Next to your position on the Silver track is indicated how much Silver you need to receive 1 Gold.
This is the only action a player can perform multiple times using just 1 action. You can obtain multiple Gold bars as long as you can pay the required amount of Silver bars.
Example:Klaus reached the 4th position on the Silver track.
This means the price for 1 Gold is 2 Silver. Klaus chooses the Turn Silver into Gold action and decides to transform 6 pieces of Silver into 3 pieces of Gold.
6. Food Tile
Take the top Food Tile and put it in the appropriate spot in front of your player screen.
From now on, this Tile will grant you 2, 3 or 4 Food of your choice during the stealing phase, in the amount as depicted on the Tile.
Important:whenever you acquire resources, it isn’t allowed to refuse any of them. Until the last round, players keep acquiring the resources depicted on the Tile.
If a player already has a Food Tile, the player is not allowed to choose this action.
7. Double offering

Take the appropriate
Tile. A player can use this Tile during one of the subsequent offering phases.
When used the player announces his double offering to the other players and uses both hands to offer not one, but two different resources to the Queen:
- Food & Silver
- OR Food & Gold
- OR Silver & Gold
Example:player Orienne puts 5 Apples in the general supply and takes 5 Silver from the general supply in exchange.
:5 5
6 3

D 9 d
The Queen will happily remove a Rock for each Bread that you give Her.
A player can remove 1 or more Rocks at any time by paying 1 Bread for each Rock. The Bread is placed in the general supply and the removed Rock is removed from the game.
This can be done anytime, e.g. when performing an action, a promotion, or even when calculating the final scoring.
8. Look into the bag

Take the appropriate
Tile. A player can use this Tile when performing a Mining action. When taking the first 2 cubes from the bag, the player is allowed to look inside the bag and choose which cubes they want.
If a player has no slaves or only 1 slave in the mine, that player is only allowed to choose 1 cube from the bag.
9. Mercy

Take the appropriate
Tile. Whenever a player needs to demote one of their promoted Pixies to the mine, this Tile can be used to beg the Queen for mercy. Miraculously, it succeeds, and the player does not need to demote a Pixie.
10. Penalty Points
When choosing this action, the player rolls the Whip die and divides Penalty Points among his opponents, equal to the number of whips on the die.
Example:Phagius rolls 3 whips and gives 1 Penalty Point to Indigeaux and 2 Penalty Points to Firenze. Firenze passes a slave symbol on the score track and has to demote a promoted Pixie to the mine immediately.
11. Gold & Silver track
- Pay 1 Gold to advance 1 step on the Gold track
- OR pay 1 Silver to advance 1 step on the Silver track.
Important:Using 1 action a player can only advance 1 step on 1 track. It’s not allowed to pay multiple times to advance multiple steps using only this 1 action.
12. Casino
The player rolls the Casino die and receives resources according to the die roll:
- 1 Apple, 1 Honey and 1 Bread
- or 2 Silver
- or 1 Gold
13. Golden Ring
The player forges 1 Golden Ring by paying the amount of Gold depicted on their position on the Gold track.
The Golden Ring is immediately offered to the Queen and the player receives the highest Golden Ring Reward tile still available.
15. Mine
By placing an Action Disc on the appropriate action space, a player activates the Pixies in their mine.
The player takes the cloth bag and pulls as many resource cubes from it as there are Pixies present in their mine. This is done without looking into the bag.
In case there are no more slaves in the mine, a player still takes 1 cube.
The Single Use Tile, Look into the bag can be used when performing this action.
A player always has to show their opponents which cubes were taken.
Silver and Gold bars are added to the resource pool a player keeps behind their screen.
Rocks are placed next to opposing Pixies in the mines on the provided spaces, chaining these Pixies into place.
Before they can leave the mine during a promotion, slaves need to rid themselves of all Rocks they are attached to.
A maximum of 2 slaves per player can be chained with a maximum of 3 Rocks per slave.
If the only slaves that can still get Rocks are the player’s own slaves, the player is obliged to enchain their own slaves. If there are no slaves left or all have been chained with 3 Rocks, the Rocks pulled are removed from the game. They are not returned to the bag.
Example:Orienne has reached the 4th step on the Gold track.
This means the cost to forge a Golden Ring is 2 Gold. Orienne has 4 Gold in total. She pays 2 Gold to forge 1 Golden Ring, as she is not allowed to forge more than one Ring with 1 action.
14. Rob a Pixie
The player chooses an opposing Pixie on a double action space. This Pixie is robbed and must give resources to the stealing player according to the small Food icons above the action space it is on.
If the victim no longer possesses all of the resources which are to be stolen, the player only hands over the resources they have remaining.
If there is no opposing promoted Pixie on the game board, this action can’t be chosen.

D 10 d
16. Trade Tiles here are 3 types of Tiles a player can exchange:
1. Food Tiles
2. Single Use Tiles
3. Permanent Ability Tiles
By choosing this action, a player can exchange 1 of their Tiles with a Tile of the same type on the game board OR on an opponent’s player screen.
If a player doesn’t own a Tile of a certain type, they can’t trade for Tiles of that type.
Exchanging with a Tile of an opponent:
- Just swap a Tile on your own player screen with a Tile of the same type on an opponent’s player screen.
- The opponent may not refuse the exchange.
Exchanging with a Tile on the game board:
- When exchanging Food Tiles, the player first takes the top Tile from the Food Tile stack and then puts the old Tile back on top.
- When trading a Single Use Tile, the player takes an available Single Use Tile of his choice on the game board and puts his Single Use Tile back on the appropriate space on the game board. e.g. A Mercy Tile goes back on the Mercy space and not on the space where you just took the other Single Use Tile from.
- When trading a Permanent Ability Tile, the old Tile is placed on the location on the game board where the new Tile came from.
17. Dump resources or take 1 Food This action is performed using a single Action Disc and is available 3 times each round.
A player can perform this action multiple times per round
(1 time per turn) as long as there is an available action space.
- EITHER remove up to 3 resources from the game (from your own supply).
- OR take 1 Apple
- OR take 1 Honey
- OR take 1 Bread
18. Copy action
Each player has a personal action space to perform this action once per round.
The 1st player to choose this action each round immediately gets 1 Penalty Point, the
2nd and 3rd get 2 Penalty Points and the 4th and 5th get 3 Penalty Points.
If the received Penalty Points move the player’s score marker onto or over a slave symbol on the score track, the player must demote a Pixie to their mine immediately.
The player performing this action chooses another action with double action spaces that has already been used this round.
Unused actions as well as single space actions can NOT be copied.
All rules apply to the copied action as if the action itself was taken. For example, whenever there is no longer a Single Use Tile available at an action spot, a player is not allowed to copy the action which grants that Single Use Tile.
19. Special Offering
Check which resources are located on the Special Offering track and offer those to the Queen. You pay these resources from your personal sypply to the general supply.
Then place 1 additional resource of your choice (Food, Silver or Gold) from your personal supply onto the Special Offering track.
This makes the action more and more expensive as the rounds progress.
Take the leftmost Tile from the associated Reward Tiles and keep it behind your player screen until final scoring.
20. Alter play priority
Pay the Queen 1 or more Honey pots (put them back in the general supply) and advance your small cube an equal amount of spaces to the left.
The large cubes remain in place for the time being. Their position will only be altered at the start of the next stealing phase. The remainder of the turn is performed using the current order of the large cubes.
21. Temporary priority
This action can be chosen by any player, even the player whose large cube is already in first place.
:

D 11 d
To perform this action, place ALL of your remaining Action Discs for this turn on the action space. The action phase ends immediately for the player who chooses this action.
Move your large cube to the front of the track of large cubes immediately. Leave the small cube track untouched.
This action temporarily makes you ‘the Queen’s Favorite’ during the remainder of the Action phase, the next Reward phase and the next Penalty phase.
This means you will be allowed to carry out the promotion steps of your Pixies in the Reward phase first, and you won’t have to demote a Pixie to the mine if you pass a slave symbol or if no one offered the correct type of Food during the Offering phase.
During the next Stealing phase however, the large cube track will be rearranged to match the small cubes track.
